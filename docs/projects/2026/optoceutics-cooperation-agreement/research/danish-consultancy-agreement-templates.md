## 2. Common Structure of Danish Consultancy Agreements

### Universal Sections (present in virtually ALL templates)

Based on cross-referencing all sources, these sections appear in every Danish consultancy agreement template examined:

1. **Parter** (Parties) - Legal names, CVR numbers, addresses
2. **Opgavebeskrivelse** (Scope of Services) - What the consultant will do
3. **Vederlag/Honorar** (Compensation) - How much, how paid, when invoiced
4. **Fortrolighed** (Confidentiality) - Mutual or one-way NDA clause
5. **Opsigelse og ophoer** (Termination) - Notice periods, how to end
6. **Underskrifter** (Signatures) - Date, place, signatures

### Very Common Sections (present in most templates)

7. **Varighed** (Duration) - Start date, end date or indefinite
8. **Selvstaendig status** (Independent Contractor Status) - Not an employee, not an agent
9. **Immaterielle rettigheder** (IP Rights) - Who owns what is created

### Common but Not Universal

10. **Ansvar/Erstatning** (Liability/Indemnification) - Limitation of liability
11. **Lovvalg og tvister** (Governing Law and Disputes) - Danish law, which court
12. **Kundens forpligtelser** (Client Obligations) - What the client must provide

### Less Common / "Nice to Have"

13. **Underleverandoerer** (Subcontractors) - Whether consultant can use subs
14. **Udgifter** (Expenses) - Travel, materials
15. **Forsikring** (Insurance) - Professional indemnity requirements
16. **Kommunikation** (Communication) - Contact persons, meeting frequency
17. **AEndringer** (Amendments) - Must be in writing
18. **GDPR/Persondata** - Data protection reference
19. **Force majeure** - Extraordinary circumstances

### NOT Typically Present in Simple Agreements

- Detailed breach penalty mechanisms
- Escrow arrangements
- Multi-tier dispute resolution (mediation then arbitration then courts)
- Background IP schedules
- Data classification tiers
- Insurance amount specifications
- Post-termination access frameworks
- Non-compete clauses (these are separate and often controversial)
- Detailed representations and warranties

## 3. Typical Length

Based on the templates analyzed:

| Type | Typical Length | When Used |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Bare minimum** (aftalebrev/letter agreement) | 1-1.5 pages | Small, short-term engagements. Supplements standard business terms. |
| **Simple consultancy agreement** | 2-3 pages | Standard Danish SME consultancy. The most common format. |
| **Standard consultancy agreement** | 3-5 pages | Larger engagements, ongoing relationships, IP-sensitive work. |
| **Comprehensive consultancy agreement** | 5-12 pages | Framework agreements with appendices, large corporations. |

The **sweet spot** for what looks "normal" in a Danish SME context is **2-3 pages**.

The Aftale-dk.com template (7 core sections) fits on approximately 2 pages. The Dokumenter.dk template (12 sections) runs approximately 4-5 pages. The DitSelskab.dk guide recommends splitting into a framework agreement (2-3 pages) plus separate task orders.

---

## 4. Language Style

Danish consultancy agreements use:

- **Semi-formal Danish or English**: Not heavy legalese, but not casual either
- **Clear, declarative sentences**: "Konsulenten udforer sit arbejde paa de aftalte tidspunkter og paa en fagmaessigt korrekt maade"
- **Minimal defined terms**: Simple agreements do not have a separate "Definitions" section. Terms are defined inline or just used naturally.
- **Direct address**: "Parterne" (the Parties), "Konsulenten" (the Consultant), "Kunden" (the Client)
- **Standard legal closing phrases**: "Underskrevet i to eksemplarer, et til hver part"
- **No footnotes**: Footnotes and cross-references are rare in simple agreements

The tone is business-practical, not academic-legal. Think: something a non-lawyer business owner wrote with guidance from an accountant or business advisor.

---

## 5. Bare Minimum Clauses (Legally Required vs. Standard Practice)

### What is LEGALLY Required?

Under Danish law (Aftaleloven), essentially nothing is formally required for a valid contract:

- No written form requirement (oral agreements are valid)
- No specific clauses mandated by statute for B2B consultancy
- No registration requirement
- No notarization requirement
- No witness requirement

In practice, the only truly "required" element is that the parties agree on what is to be done and what the consideration is.

### What is PRACTICALLY Required (bare minimum for a real consultancy)?

A consultant agreement that will pass basic scrutiny (e.g., by SKAT, a Notified Body, or in court) should at minimum establish:

1. **Who** the parties are (names, CVR)
2. **What** the consultant will do (scope of services)
3. **How much** the consultant will be paid (or what other consideration applies)
4. **That the consultant is independent** (not an employee) - critical for SKAT
5. **How long** the agreement lasts and how to end it

Everything else is risk management, not legal requirement.

### What is UNIVERSALLY PRESENT even in the simplest agreements?

Adding confidentiality to the above five items covers what appears in essentially every template examined, even the shortest ones.

---

## 6. Answers to Specific Questions

### Do simple Danish consultancy agreements typically include liability clauses?

**Mixed.** The simplest templates (Aftale-dk.com, IVN, Dinero) do NOT include liability limitation clauses. The more comprehensive templates (Dokumenter.dk, Contractbook, LegalUp) DO include them.

In Danish practice: if nothing is stated about liability, general Danish tort law applies, which means **unlimited fault-based liability** (no cap). Including a basic liability limitation is considered prudent but is not universal in simple agreements.

**For agreements with no cash payment**: Liability clauses are less common because the economic stakes appear lower. However, Danish law does not reduce liability just because no money changes hands - this is a trap.

**Verdict**: A short liability clause (2-3 sentences excluding indirect loss and capping aggregate liability) would NOT look unusual, but its absence would also not raise eyebrows in a simple consultancy agreement.

### Do they include "no partnership" clauses?

**Sometimes, but phrased differently.** Danish templates typically phrase this as part of the independent contractor status clause rather than as a standalone "no partnership" provision.

Common formulation: "Konsulenten er selvstaendig erhvervsdrivende og er ikke berettiget til at indgaa aftaler paa Kundens vegne" (The consultant is self-employed and is not entitled to enter into agreements on the Client's behalf).

A full Anglo-American-style "Nothing in this Agreement creates a partnership, joint venture, or agency" clause is uncommon in simple Danish agreements but not unusual in more formal ones. In Danish legal practice, the independent contractor clause achieves the same purpose.

**Verdict**: The clause in Regla's draft v02 (Section 1.4) combining "no partnership" with "no authority to bind" is reasonable but slightly formal for a simple agreement. Could be shortened to one sentence.

### Do they specify what the client must provide?

**Yes, this is standard.** Most templates include a section on the client's obligations (Kundens forpligtelser / Virksomhedens forpligtelser). Typical provisions:

- Access to premises, systems, and personnel
- Providing necessary information and documentation
- Timely feedback on deliverables
- Designating a contact person

Dokumenter.dk template has a dedicated "Buyer's Assistance" section. LegalDesk lists "Company Obligations" as one of their 6 recommended sections.

**Verdict**: Section 1.2 of Regla's draft v02 (OptoCeutics facilitating access) is standard practice.

### How do they handle IP when the consultant retains ownership?

**This is the default in Danish law.** Under Danish copyright law (Ophavsretsloven), the creator of a work owns the copyright. For an independent consultant (not an employee), this means the consultant retains IP ownership of what they create unless explicitly assigned.

Standard approaches in Danish templates:

1. **Silent (simplest)**: No IP clause at all. Default law applies = consultant owns. Very common in short agreements.
2. **Brief acknowledgment**: "Konsulenten bevarer alle immaterielle rettigheder til det producerede materiale" (Consultant retains all IP). Client gets a use license.
3. **License grant**: Consultant retains ownership, grants client a license (non-exclusive, perpetual, for internal use).
4. **Assignment**: IP transfers to client upon payment. More common in agency/creative contracts.

**For Regla's situation**: A brief statement that Regla owns Platform IP + a license to OptoCeutics is well within normal practice for a consultancy where the consultant uses their own tools/platform.

**Verdict**: Section 2 of draft v02 is standard. The source code license concept is slightly more specific than typical but not unusual for software/tech consultancy.

### How do they handle confidentiality - embedded or separate NDA?

**Overwhelmingly embedded.** Every source examined recommends or practices embedding the confidentiality clause directly in the consultancy agreement, not as a separate NDA document.

Standard approach:
- 1-3 paragraphs within the agreement
- Mutual obligation ("alle forhold som den ene part erfarer...")
- Survives termination (typically stated as "ogsaa efter aftalens ophoer")
- Standard exceptions (public information, prior knowledge, legal requirement)

A separate NDA is used when:
- Confidential information is exchanged BEFORE the consultancy agreement is signed
- The confidentiality scope is significantly different from the consultancy scope
- Multiple parties or subcontractors are involved

**Verdict**: The embedded approach in Regla's draft v02 Section 4 is standard practice. The length (5 sub-sections) is on the longer side for a simple agreement; 2-3 sub-sections would be more typical for a "boring" consultancy.

### Do they include non-compete/use restrictions?

**Rarely in simple agreements.** Non-compete clauses are legally sensitive in Denmark and are governed by specific rules (Funktionaerloven for employees; general contract law for consultants, but courts may apply analogous restrictions).

Use restrictions (as distinct from non-compete) are even less common. They appear primarily in:
- Software licensing contexts
- Franchise agreements
- Agreements involving significant trade secret transfer

**Verdict**: Section 3 (Use Restrictions) in draft v02 is the element MOST likely to make the agreement look like "more than a standard consultancy." This section, with its AI rewriting prohibition and 24-month post-termination restriction, is atypical for a standard Danish consultancy agreement. It signals that something valuable (source code) is being shared, which is true but undermines the "boring consultancy" objective.

## 8. Benchmarking Regla's Draft v02

### What is STANDARD in draft v02 (would not raise eyebrows)

| Section | Assessment | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Parties identification | Standard | CVR numbers, addresses - totally normal |
| Background (A, B) | Standard | Brief description of what each party does - normal |
| Section 1.1-1.2 (Services + Client facilitation) | Standard | Describing what consultant does and what client provides - textbook |
| Section 1.3 (No minimum hours) | Standard | Common for flexible/ongoing consultancy arrangements |
| Section 2.1 (Regla owns Platform IP) | Standard | Normal for consultant retaining IP in own tools |
| Section 2.2 (OptoCeutics owns own data) | Standard | Standard IP delineation |
| Section 4.1-4.3 (Core confidentiality) | Standard | Mutual NDA, standard exceptions - completely normal |
| Section 6 (Term and Termination) | Standard | Indefinite with notice period and breach clause - textbook |
| Section 7.1 (Danish law, Copenhagen courts) | Standard | Completely standard |
| Section 7.2 (Amendments in writing, entire agreement) | Standard | Boilerplate, expected |
| Signature blocks | Standard | Normal format |

### What is SLIGHTLY UNUSUAL but defensible in draft v02

| Section | Assessment | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Background C (no cash payment) | Slightly unusual | Most consultancy agreements involve cash payment. The explicit mention of non-cash consideration draws attention to the unusual commercial structure. However, it is transparent and legitimate. |
| Section 1.4 (No partnership clause) | Slightly formal | Anglo-American style "no partnership, no joint venture" language. Danish templates handle this more briefly as part of independent contractor status. Not alarming, just slightly lawyerly. |
| Section 2.3-2.4 (Source code license) | Unusual for consultancy | Source code licensing is more of a software licensing concept. In a standard consultancy, the client would typically get use rights to deliverables, not a "source code license." This signals sophistication beyond a routine consultancy. |
| Section 4.4 (Regulatory audit carve-out) | Sector-specific | Not unusual for medtech but not standard boilerplate. Signals awareness of regulatory context. |
| Section 4.5 (3-year survival) | Standard | Duration is normal; 3-5 years is typical range. |
| Section 5 (Liability limitation) | Standard | EUR 50K cap with gross negligence carve-out is reasonable. A bit formal for a no-money agreement but legally prudent. |
| Section 7.3 (GDPR reference) | Slightly unusual | Most simple consultancy agreements do not reference GDPR unless personal data processing is core to the engagement. Brief reference is fine. |

### What STANDS OUT as non-standard (potential "red flag" for someone wanting a boring contract)

| Section | Assessment | Why It Stands Out |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Section 3 (Use Restrictions) - entire section** | Non-standard | This is the most atypical section. Standard consultancy agreements do not have "Use Restrictions." This reads like a software license restriction, not a consultancy term. The AI rewriting prohibition (3.2) is especially unusual and signals legal sophistication. |
| **Section 2.5 (License survives but revokes on breach)** | Unusual mechanism | The conditional survival/revocation mechanism is sophisticated contract engineering, not a standard consultancy provision. |
| **Section 4.1 (Trade secret acknowledgment)** | Slightly heavy | The explicit reference to "Danish Trade Secrets Act (Lov om forretningshemmeligheder)" is more formal than typical consultancy NDAs, which just say "fortrolige oplysninger." |

---

## 9. Recommendations for Regla's Case

### To achieve the "goes under the radar" objective:

**Priority 1: Remove or absorb Section 3 (Use Restrictions)**

This is the section that most makes the agreement look like a software license rather than a consultancy contract. Options:

- **Option A (recommended)**: Remove entirely. The confidentiality clause (Section 4) and the license terms (Section 2.3-2.4) already restrict misuse. The NDA prevents disclosure; the license terms prevent distribution.
- **Option B**: Merge the core restriction into Section 2 as a sub-clause: "The source code license does not include the right to develop competing products for third-party distribution." One sentence instead of three sub-sections.

**Priority 2: Simplify IP/License section**

Instead of the current 5 sub-sections (2.1-2.5), consolidate to 2-3:
- Regla owns its IP
- OptoCeutics retains its own IP
- OptoCeutics gets a non-exclusive license for internal use (including own products), not for third-party distribution. License survives termination.

**Priority 3: Shorten confidentiality**

Reduce from 5 sub-sections to 3:
- Mutual confidentiality obligation (drop the explicit "trade secret" label)
- Standard exceptions
- Survives termination for [X] years

**Priority 4: Consider dropping the explicit "no cash payment" recital**

Background C draws attention to the unusual commercial arrangement. A simpler approach: just describe the arrangement naturally in the services and consideration sections without highlighting that no money changes hands. The consultancy framing naturally implies that Regla provides services and OptoCeutics provides access/feedback.

### Summary: What a "boring" version of draft v02 would look like

```
CONSULTANCY AGREEMENT

Parties (with CVR)

Background (2 sentences: Regla provides AI/QMS consultancy. OptoCeutics engages Regla.)

1. Services and Facilitation (~1.1-1.3, simplified)
2. Intellectual Property (~2.1-2.3 consolidated)
3. Confidentiality (~4.1-4.3, shortened)
4. Liability (5.1-5.2 as-is, or remove entirely)
5. Term and Termination (6.1-6.4, streamlined)
6. General Provisions (7.1-7.2, drop GDPR reference)

Signatures
```

**Result: ~1.5-2 pages, 6 sections. Looks like every other consultancy agreement signed in Denmark.**

### What to KEEP regardless of simplification

Even in the simplest version, retain:
1. Clear IP ownership (Regla owns Platform)
2. Source code license terms (non-exclusive, internal use, non-distributable)
3. Basic mutual confidentiality
4. Independent contractor / no partnership statement (even if just one sentence)

These are the elements that actually protect Regla, and they are all within the range of what appears in standard Danish consultancy agreements.
