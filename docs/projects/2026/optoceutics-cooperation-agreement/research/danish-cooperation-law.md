## 1. The Governing Legal Framework

### 1.1 There Is No "Cooperation Agreement Act" -- and That Is Your Weapon

Danish law has no specific statute governing cooperation agreements (samarbejdsaftaler). This is not a gap -- it is a deliberate feature of the Danish legal system that massively benefits the drafter of a well-constructed agreement.

The governing framework is:

1. **Aftaleloven (Danish Contracts Act, Consolidated Act No. 193/1986)** -- the foundational statute for all contractual relationships in Denmark. It governs formation, validity, powers of attorney, and the general clause (Section 36) on unfair terms.
2. **General principles of Danish contract law (dansk obligationsret)** -- judge-made law and legal doctrine covering interpretation, breach, termination, and remedies. These are not codified in a single statute but derive from Supreme Court (Hojesteret) precedent and authoritative legal scholarship (especially Ussing and Gomard).
3. **Kobloven (Danish Sale of Goods Act)** -- applicable only if the cooperation involves supply of goods, which it does not here.
4. **Konkurrenceloven (Danish Competition Act)** -- relevant if the cooperation could restrict competition (addressed in Section 6 below).

**Key insight**: Because cooperation agreements sit in a largely unregulated contractual space, the principle of **aftalefrihed** (freedom of contract) dominates almost absolutely between commercial parties. The parties can design virtually any arrangement they want, subject only to:
- Mandatory law (very limited for B2B commercial contracts)
- Section 36 of the Aftaleloven (the "unfairness" general clause, applied very restrictively between commercial parties)
- Public policy and illegality

This means the agreement can be radically simple and still be fully enforceable. There is no statutory minimum content, no registration requirement, no mandatory form.

### 1.2 Mandatory Provisions (There Are Almost None)

For a B2B cooperation agreement between two Danish ApS entities, the mandatory provisions are remarkably few:

- **No written form required**: Danish law treats oral and written contracts as equally binding. There are no formality requirements -- no notarization, no registration, no witnesses. (Obviously, you want it in writing for evidentiary purposes, but the law does not require it.)
- **No consideration requirement**: Unlike common law systems, Danish law does not require "consideration" for a contract to be valid. An agreement where one party provides free access to a platform in exchange for data and expertise is perfectly valid without needing to establish a monetary quid pro quo.
- **No minimum duration**: The agreement can be indefinite, fixed-term, or tied to milestones.
- **No mandatory dispute resolution**: Parties can choose courts, arbitration, mediation, or any combination.

The only true mandatory provisions are:
1. **Section 36 Aftaleloven**: A court may modify or set aside terms that are unreasonable ("urimelig") or contrary to good faith ("redelig handlemade"). Between commercial parties, this is applied extremely restrictively. The Danish Supreme Court has consistently held that commercial parties bear their own risk in negotiations and courts should not second-guess bargains struck between professionals. (See Schjodt research 2024: Section 36 is "still applied restrictively in contractual relationships between businesses.")
2. **Competition law**: The agreement must not restrict competition in a way prohibited by the Konkurrenceloven Sections 6-7 (mirroring EU Articles 101-102 TFEU).
3. **GDPR**: If personal data is exchanged, data processing terms are mandatory. (Covered by separate research stream.)

### 1.3 The Danish Contracts Act -- What Actually Matters

The Aftaleloven's most relevant provisions for this agreement:

- **Sections 1-9 (Formation)**: Offer and acceptance rules. Not particularly relevant for a negotiated bilateral agreement -- these mainly govern situations where parties dispute whether a contract was formed.
- **Section 36 (General Clause)**: The safety net. A term can be set aside if enforcing it would be unreasonable considering the circumstances at contract formation, the contract's content, later events, and other circumstances. Between two commercial parties of roughly comparable sophistication, this is nearly impossible to invoke successfully.
- **Sections 28-33 (Invalidity)**: Contracts can be voided for duress (Section 28), exploitation of distress/inexperience (Section 31), or fraud (Section 30). Not relevant here.
- **Section 38d (Electronic contracts)**: Electronic signatures are valid. The agreement can be signed via DocuSign or similar.

**Creative angle**: Because Section 36 is so restrictive between commercial parties, you can include terms that would be unenforceable in consumer contracts -- aggressive IP assignments, broad confidentiality obligations, expansive non-compete-like provisions around competing platforms. The agreement can be tilted significantly in Regla's favor on IP without triggering Section 36 concerns, provided the overall bargain is not grossly disproportionate.

## 2. Why a Cooperation Agreement Beats Every Alternative

### 2.1 The Four Structural Options Under Danish Law

| Structure | Legal Form | Liability | Tax Entity | Complexity | Fit for This Deal |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Cooperation Agreement** | Pure contract | Each party bears own liability | No separate entity | Minimal | Ideal |
| **Joint Venture (JV)** | New ApS/A/S | Limited (via new entity) | Separate corporate tax entity | High | Overkill |
| **Interessentskab (I/S)** | General partnership | Joint and several, unlimited | Pass-through to partners | Medium | Dangerous |
| **Consortium** | Contractual alliance | Per agreement | No separate entity | Medium | Unnecessary |

### 2.2 Why NOT a Joint Venture

A JV under Danish law typically involves creating a new legal entity (usually an ApS with minimum DKK 40,000 capital). This is catastrophically wrong for this deal because:

1. **IP ownership becomes messy**: If the JV entity develops the platform, the JV entity owns the IP -- not Regla. Unwinding this later requires complex IP assignments and potential tax consequences.
2. **Tax inefficiency**: A JV entity pays 22% corporate tax on profits. Since no profits are expected from the cooperation itself (Regla commercializes separately), the JV would be a cost center with no upside.
3. **Exit complexity**: Dissolving a JV requires formal liquidation or share transfers. Ending a cooperation agreement requires a letter.
4. **Governance overhead**: JV requires articles of association, shareholder agreement, board composition, annual reporting. Completely unnecessary.
5. **Signal to OptoCeutics**: A JV signals shared ownership and shared destiny. That is not the deal. Regla owns the platform; OptoCeutics is a contributing partner, not a co-owner.

### 2.3 Why NOT an I/S (Interessentskab)

An I/S would be the worst possible structure because:

1. **Unlimited joint and several liability**: Each partner is liable for all of the partnership's obligations with personal assets. For a 5-person startup cooperating with a 50-person company, this is asymmetric risk that destroys value.
2. **Accidental partnership risk**: Under Danish law, if two parties cooperate closely enough, a court could characterize the relationship as a de facto I/S even without formal agreement. **This is actually a reason to have an explicit cooperation agreement that states the relationship is NOT a partnership.**
3. **Pass-through taxation**: I/S income is taxed as personal income of partners (up to 55.9%), rather than corporate tax (22%). Disastrous.

### 2.4 Why NOT a Consortium

A consortium is functionally similar to a cooperation agreement but carries connotations of joint bidding, shared project execution, and temporary pooling of resources for a specific deliverable. It is too structured for this relationship and implies a level of joint venture-like coordination that does not exist here. The cooperation is ongoing, not project-specific.

### 2.5 Why a Cooperation Agreement IS Correct

A cooperation agreement (samarbejdsaftale) is simply a contract between two independent parties who agree to work together. Under Danish law:

- **No new entity is created** -- each party remains independent
- **No joint liability** -- unless explicitly agreed (do not agree to this)
- **No registration required** -- it exists from the moment both parties sign
- **No minimum capital** -- there is nothing to capitalize
- **IP stays where you put it** -- Regla owns what Regla creates, full stop
- **Termination is simple** -- give notice, walk away (subject to agreed terms)
- **Tax neutral** -- each party accounts for its own activities on its own books

**Creative insight**: The cooperation agreement should include an explicit "negative partnership" clause stating that the agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, or I/S, and that neither party is an agent of the other. This is standard in Danish commercial practice and prevents any court from recharacterizing the relationship.

---

## 3. Enforceability -- What Makes It Bulletproof

### 3.1 Formation Requirements

Under Danish law, a contract is formed when:
1. There is an **offer** (tilbud) and **acceptance** (accept) -- Section 1, Aftaleloven
2. The parties have **legal capacity** (retsevne) -- both ApS entities have this by default
3. The subject matter is not **illegal** or contrary to public policy

That is it. No consideration needed. No writing needed. No registration needed.

### 3.2 How to Maximize Enforceability

While the legal bar is low, practical enforceability depends on:

1. **Written form**: Always. Oral cooperation agreements are legal but provably useless.
2. **Clear identification of parties**: Full company names, CVR numbers, registered addresses.
3. **Defined scope**: What are the parties cooperating on? The more specific, the better.
4. **Explicit obligations**: What does each party commit to deliver? Vague "best efforts" obligations are hard to enforce. Concrete commitments ("OptoCeutics shall provide access to its QMS documentation within 30 days") are enforceable.
5. **Remedies for breach**: Danish default rules provide remedies for breach (damages, termination), but spelling them out avoids disputes.
6. **Signatures by authorized representatives**: Directors (direktorer) registered with Erhvervsstyrelsen can bind the company. Check the company register (CVR) for signing authority.

### 3.3 The Danish Interpretation Rules

When disputes arise over meaning, Danish courts apply:

1. **Literal interpretation first**: The words of the contract control, interpreted according to their ordinary commercial meaning.
2. **Contextual interpretation**: If ambiguous, courts look at the contract as a whole, the negotiations, prior dealings, and trade practice.
3. **The ambiguity rule (uklarhedsreglen)**: If a term is still ambiguous after contextual interpretation, it is interpreted against the drafter. **Since Regla is drafting, every ambiguity will be resolved against Regla. Draft clearly.**
4. **Good faith (god tro)**: Courts expect parties to act in good faith and will interpret terms in light of what reasonable commercial parties would have understood.

### 3.4 Implied Obligations -- The Loyalitetspligt

Danish law implies a **loyalty obligation (loyalitetspligt)** in cooperation agreements. This means:

- Each party must act in the other's legitimate interests within the scope of the cooperation
- Neither party may undermine the purpose of the agreement
- Information relevant to the cooperation must be shared (not withheld strategically)
- The concept of **reciprocity** (gensidighed) means courts expect a reasonable balance of obligations

This implied loyalty obligation is both a protection and a constraint. It means OptoCeutics cannot secretly share Regla's platform details with a competitor, but it also means Regla cannot use the cooperation purely extractively without delivering genuine value to OptoCeutics.

**Strategic point**: The implied loyalty obligation is actually an argument for keeping the agreement simple. The more you define specific obligations, the more you limit the scope of the implied duty. In some cases, it is better to rely on the broad implied duty (which protects both parties) than to try to enumerate every possible scenario.

---

## 4. Creative Structuring Options

### 4.1 The "Contribution Agreement" Frame (Recommended)

Instead of framing this as a two-party cooperation where both sides have complex reciprocal obligations, frame it as a **contribution model**:

- **OptoCeutics contributes**: QMS data access, domain expertise, testing/validation feedback, use cases
- **Regla contributes**: Technology development, platform access, integration support
- **Each party's contribution is self-standing** -- not contingent on the other's performance in a tit-for-tat sense

This framing has several advantages:
1. **Avoids "partnership" characterization**: Contributions are one-directional flows, not joint execution
2. **Simplifies IP ownership**: Regla builds on contributions; the output belongs to Regla
3. **Reduces governance**: No joint steering committee needed, no shared decision-making authority
4. **Tax clarity**: Each party's contribution can be valued independently

### 4.2 The "Founding Partner" Clause

Rather than calling OptoCeutics a "co-development partner" (which implies shared ownership), designate them as a **"Founding Partner"** or **"Development Partner"** with a contractual status that is clearly not equity-based. This:

- Gives OptoCeutics a prestigious title they can use in marketing
- Creates clear hierarchical distinction (Regla develops, partner contributes)
- Avoids IP ownership ambiguity entirely
- Can be used as a commercial reference with their consent

### 4.3 The "Platform Access Right" Instead of "License"

Instead of granting OptoCeutics a "perpetual license" (which has specific IP law connotations and can create arguments about scope, sublicensing, transferability), grant them a **"Perpetual Platform Access Right"**. This:

- Is contractual, not IP-based -- it is a right to use the service, not a license to the underlying IP
- Is simpler to define (access = ability to log in and use the platform)
- Is easier to limit (access can be conditioned on compliance with terms of use)
- Does not create arguments about whether OptoCeutics has the right to modify, reverse-engineer, or sublicense
- Survives termination of the cooperation agreement by its own force (the access right is perpetual regardless of whether the parties continue cooperating)

**Creative structure**: Make the perpetual access right a **standalone schedule** to the cooperation agreement. This means if the cooperation terminates, the access right survives as a freestanding contractual commitment. It also means the access right can be modified independently of the cooperation terms.

### 4.4 The "Milestone Ratchet" for Scope Expansion

Instead of defining the full cooperation scope upfront, use a milestone-based scope expansion:

- **Phase 1**: QMS documentation automation (immediate scope)
- **Phase 2**: Maintained analysis (triggered by successful Phase 1 delivery)
- **Phase 3**: Full regulatory strategy (triggered by mutual agreement)

Each phase can be activated by simple written confirmation (even email) without amending the master agreement. This keeps the initial agreement short while allowing growth.

### 4.5 The Single-Document Strategy

Under Danish law, there is no legal reason to have separate documents for the cooperation agreement, NDA, IP assignment, and data access terms. **Embed everything in one document.** This:

- Reduces total page count (no duplicative recitals, definitions, boilerplate)
- Eliminates conflicts between documents
- Makes the agreement easier to negotiate (one markup, not five)
- Is fully enforceable -- Danish courts do not require NDA-type obligations to be in a separate document

Structure it as:
1. Cooperation terms (3-4 pages)
2. Confidentiality obligations (1-2 pages, embedded as a section)
3. IP ownership (1 page, embedded)
4. Data access terms (1 page, embedded)
5. Standard boilerplate (1-2 pages)

Total: 8-12 pages for a complete, enforceable agreement.

---

## 5. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

### 5.1 Choice of Law

Both parties are Danish. The cooperation occurs in Denmark. Danish law is the obvious and correct choice.

However, consider these nuances:

1. **International commercialization**: The Regla platform will be sold internationally, but the cooperation agreement governs the Regla-OptoCeutics relationship only. International sales will have their own terms of service. The cooperation agreement should be governed by Danish law.

2. **EU mandatory rules**: Certain EU regulations (GDPR, competition law, potentially the EU AI Act) apply regardless of choice of law. These do not need to be addressed through governing law -- they apply by their own force.

3. **CISG exclusion**: The UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) applies by default to international sales contracts where both parties are in CISG member states. Denmark is a CISG member. Although CISG likely does not apply to a cooperation agreement (it governs sales of goods), include a **CISG exclusion clause** as a belt-and-suspenders measure.

### 5.2 Dispute Resolution -- The Creative Option

Standard approach: Danish ordinary courts (Byretten in the district where the defendant is domiciled).

**Creative alternative**: **Danish Institute of Arbitration (Voldgiftsinstituttet)** with expedited rules. For a cooperation between a 5-person and 50-person company, arbitration offers:

- **Speed**: Expedited arbitration can be completed in 3-6 months vs. 12-24 months in courts
- **Confidentiality**: Court proceedings are public; arbitration is private. Critical for protecting trade secrets.
- **Expertise**: Arbitrators can be selected for technology/IP expertise
- **Enforceability**: Denmark is a party to the New York Convention, making arbitral awards enforceable in 170+ countries

**Even more creative**: Include a **mandatory mediation step** before arbitration. Mediation is cheap, fast, and preserves the commercial relationship. If mediation fails, escalate to arbitration. This is increasingly common in Danish tech agreements and signals sophistication.

**Recommended clause**: "Any dispute arising out of this agreement shall first be submitted to mediation under the rules of the Danish Institute of Arbitration. If the dispute is not resolved within 60 days, it shall be finally settled by arbitration under the expedited rules of the Danish Institute of Arbitration."

## 6. Competition Law Considerations

### 6.1 The Risk Assessment

The Konkurrenceloven (Danish Competition Act) prohibits agreements that restrict competition (Section 6, mirroring Article 101 TFEU). A cooperation agreement between Regla and OptoCeutics could theoretically raise concerns if:

1. **Exclusivity**: If OptoCeutics agrees not to use competing platforms, this is a vertical restraint
2. **Information exchange**: Sharing QMS data and pricing/strategy information between companies in related markets
3. **Market allocation**: If the agreement divides markets or customers

### 6.2 Why This Deal Is Very Likely Safe

The de minimis exception applies: agreements between parties with combined market shares below 10% (horizontal) or 15% (vertical) are generally exempt. Regla is a startup with negligible market share. OptoCeutics is a single medical device company. The combined market share in "QMS automation software" or "medical device compliance platforms" is trivially small.

Additionally, this is a **vertical cooperation** (technology provider + customer), not horizontal (two competitors). Vertical cooperations are treated more leniently under Danish and EU competition law.

**Practical advice**: Do not include exclusivity clauses that prevent OptoCeutics from using competing platforms. This eliminates any competition law concern while costing Regla nothing -- if the platform is good, OptoCeutics will not switch; if it is bad, a non-compete clause will not save the relationship.

---

## 7. Tax Implications

### 7.1 The "Free Access" Question

When Regla provides OptoCeutics with free perpetual platform access in exchange for QMS data and expertise, Danish tax authorities (Skattestyrelsen) could theoretically characterize this as:

1. **Barter transaction**: Services exchanged for services, with each side taxable on the market value of what it receives
2. **Donation/gift**: Free service provided without adequate consideration (taxable as disguised distribution or non-deductible expense)
3. **Legitimate business cooperation**: Normal business activity with no separate tax event

### 7.2 Transfer Pricing -- The Key Analysis

Danish transfer pricing rules (ligningslovens Section 2) apply to **controlled transactions** between related parties. Regla and OptoCeutics are NOT related parties (no ownership link, no common control). Therefore:

**Transfer pricing rules do not apply.** The arm's length principle is irrelevant for transactions between independent parties.

This is a critical structural advantage. If OptoCeutics were a Regla subsidiary or affiliate, providing free platform access would be a transfer pricing nightmare. As independent parties, they can agree to whatever terms they want.

### 7.3 VAT on Barter Transactions

Under Danish VAT law (momsloven) and the EU VAT Directive, barter transactions where goods or services are exchanged are treated as two separate supplies, each subject to VAT on their market value.

**The question**: Is this a barter? Regla provides platform access (a service). OptoCeutics provides QMS data access and domain expertise (also services). If characterized as barter, both sides must charge and remit 25% Danish VAT on the market value of the services received.

**The creative solution**: Structure the agreement so that:
1. **OptoCeutics' data contribution** is not a "service" but a **grant of access** for Regla's development purposes. OptoCeutics does not "do work" for Regla -- it permits access.
2. **Regla's platform access** is provided as a **development partner benefit**, not as consideration for services rendered.

Alternatively, and more robustly:
3. **Acknowledge the exchange** and have each party issue invoices for the market value of their contributions (with VAT), effectively netting out. This is cleaner from a tax compliance perspective but adds administrative burden.

**Recommendation**: Consult with Regla's accountant/tax advisor on the VAT treatment before signing. The cooperation agreement itself should be structured to support the most favorable tax characterization, but the specific approach requires accounting guidance.

### 7.4 Corporate Tax Deductibility

For Regla, the costs of developing the platform are deductible business expenses regardless of the cooperation agreement. The "free" access given to OptoCeutics is not a separate expense -- it is the absence of revenue from one user of a platform that serves many.

For OptoCeutics, providing access to QMS data costs them essentially nothing (marginal cost is zero). Their domain expertise contribution is staff time that they would incur regardless.

**Net tax impact**: Likely minimal for both parties, but confirm with tax advisor.

---

## 8. Termination and Unwinding

### 8.1 Default Rules (If the Agreement Is Silent)

Under general principles of Danish contract law, if a cooperation agreement does not address termination:

1. **Indefinite agreements**: Either party may terminate with **reasonable notice** (rimelig varsel). What is "reasonable" is assessed case-by-case based on:
   - Duration of the cooperation
   - Level of investment/reliance by each party
   - Industry practice
   - Time needed to find alternatives

   For a technology cooperation of this nature, courts would likely consider 3-6 months reasonable. But this is uncertain -- which is why you should specify.

2. **Material breach**: A party may terminate without notice for material breach (vasentlig misligholdelse). This is always available regardless of what the agreement says.

3. **Changed circumstances (bristende forudsaetninger)**: Danish law recognizes a doctrine similar to frustration/force majeure. If fundamental assumptions underlying the agreement prove false, the agreement may be terminated or modified. This is rarely invoked successfully.

### 8.2 Recommended Termination Framework

Design a termination structure that is both simple and comprehensive:

1. **Termination for convenience**: Either party, 6 months written notice
2. **Termination for material breach**: 30-day cure period, then immediate termination
3. **Termination for insolvency**: Immediate termination if either party enters bankruptcy, liquidation, or composition proceedings
4. **Automatic survival provisions**: Confidentiality obligations survive 3-5 years. IP ownership provisions survive indefinitely. The perpetual platform access right survives (it is self-standing).

### 8.3 The Unwinding Problem -- Solve It in Advance

The hardest part of termination is unwinding data and access. Address these upfront:

- **Regla's obligations on termination**: Continue providing platform access (perpetual right). Return or destroy OptoCeutics' confidential information.
- **OptoCeutics' obligations on termination**: Cease providing new data/expertise. Existing data already provided remains available to Regla for continued platform development (this must be explicitly stated).
- **No clawback**: OptoCeutics cannot retroactively withdraw data it has already provided that has been incorporated into the platform. This is critical for Regla's business continuity.

**Creative clause**: Include a "data irrevocability" provision stating that any data or insights provided by OptoCeutics that have been incorporated into the platform's general functionality (anonymized/aggregated) become Regla's property irrevocably. Only raw, identifiable OptoCeutics data must be returned or destroyed.

## 9. Market Practice and Precedent

### 9.1 How Danish Startups Actually Do This

Danish startup cooperation agreements with larger companies typically follow one of three patterns:

1. **The Handshake-Plus**: A 2-3 page letter agreement covering scope, IP, and confidentiality. Common in early-stage relationships where speed matters more than comprehensiveness. Risk: underprotects IP.

2. **The Template Overload**: A 30+ page agreement adapted from a law firm template, covering every conceivable scenario. Common when one party insists on using external lawyers who bill by the hour. Risk: over-engineered, expensive to negotiate.

3. **The Goldilocks Agreement**: An 8-15 page single document that covers the essential terms clearly without unnecessary complexity. This is what well-advised Danish startups produce.

**Recommendation**: Target the Goldilocks approach. 8-12 pages, single document, plain language, embedded NDA and IP terms.

### 9.2 What Goes Wrong in Danish Co-Development Deals

Common failure modes from Danish practice:

1. **Ambiguous IP ownership**: The agreement says "jointly developed IP" without defining who owns what. Both parties claim ownership. Litigation ensues. **Solution**: Regla owns all IP, period. No joint ownership, no ambiguity.

2. **No termination mechanics**: The cooperation sours but neither party knows how to end it. The relationship becomes toxic. **Solution**: Clear termination for convenience with reasonable notice.

3. **Data hostage situations**: The larger company provides data, then threatens to withdraw it if terms are not renegotiated. **Solution**: Data irrevocability clause (Section 8.3 above).

4. **Scope creep**: The cooperation expands informally beyond the original agreement without updated terms. **Solution**: Milestone ratchet (Section 4.4) that requires written confirmation for scope expansion.

5. **Competing platform risk**: The larger company uses knowledge gained from the cooperation to build or invest in a competing platform. **Solution**: Non-compete or non-invest clause limited to the cooperation scope and a reasonable post-termination period (12-24 months).
