# Consultancy Framing Research: Regla-OptoCeutics Agreement

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Author:** Legal Research Agent (Regla OS)
**Status:** Research Complete
**Purpose:** Assess whether a consultancy agreement framing is legally viable for the Regla-OptoCeutics co-development relationship under Danish law

---

## Executive Summary

A consultancy agreement where Regla works "for free" in exchange for retaining IP and gaining data access is **legally valid under Danish law**, but carries specific risks around VAT treatment and potential recharacterization. Danish law does not require monetary consideration (vederlag) for a valid contract. The consultant-retains-IP structure is actually the **default position** under Danish copyright law. The primary risks are: (1) SKAT treating the arrangement as a barter subject to 25% VAT on the market value of exchanged services, and (2) a court looking through the "consultancy" label to the co-development substance if a dispute arises. These risks can be mitigated through careful drafting.

## 1. Danish Contract Law on Consideration (Vederlag)

### Key Finding: No Consideration Requirement

Unlike common law jurisdictions (UK, US), **Danish contract law does not recognize the concept of consideration**. Under the Danish Contracts Act (Aftaleloven), contract formation is based purely on **offer and acceptance** (Section 1). A contract is valid if the parties reach agreement, regardless of form or whether money changes hands.

This means a consultancy agreement where no cash payment flows in either direction is **not invalid for lack of consideration**. The agreement binds because both parties agreed to it, not because value was exchanged.

### Fairness and Reciprocity

However, Danish law does incorporate a **reciprocity expectation**. The concept of "fairness and reasonableness" (rimelighed og redelig handlemade) creates a presumption that contracts should involve mutual consideration. If reciprocity is absent, there is a rebuttable presumption that the contract was concluded contrary to principles of fairness.

**Practical implication:** The agreement should clearly articulate what each party provides, even if no cash changes hands. Regla provides consulting services and platform access; OptoCeutics provides QMS data access, domain expertise, and feedback. This mutual exchange satisfies the reciprocity expectation.

### Section 36 -- The Fairness Safety Valve

Aftaleloven Section 36 permits courts to modify or set aside contracts (in whole or part) that would be "unreasonable or at variance with the principles of good faith" to enforce. However, Danish courts are **notably restrained** in applying Section 36 to B2B contracts. The Supreme Court (U.2012.3007H) has affirmed that professional parties are presumed capable of understanding and managing the consequences of their agreements.

**Risk level: LOW.** Two sophisticated companies agreeing to a no-cash consultancy arrangement is unlikely to trigger Section 36 intervention.

## 2. Consultancy Agreement Norms in Denmark

### Consultant Retains IP by Default

Under the Danish Copyright Act (Ophavsretsloven), **the creator of a work owns the copyright**. For consultants and contractors, there is **no automatic transfer** of IP to the client, unlike the employment context where an implied transfer exists for work created within the employer's ordinary business activities.

This means:
- A consultancy agreement where Regla retains all IP in its platform is the **legal default** under Danish law
- OptoCeutics would need an **explicit contractual clause** to acquire IP -- without one, Regla automatically retains it
- The agreement does not need to "carve out" IP retention; it simply needs to avoid assigning it away

**This is a significant advantage of the consultancy framing.** Under a cooperation/co-development agreement, IP ownership becomes murkier because joint development can create arguments for joint ownership.

### No-Payment Consultancy

There is no statutory requirement in Denmark that a consultant must be paid in cash. The Aftaleloven governs, and as established above, no consideration is required. A consultancy agreement can specify non-monetary compensation (IP retention, data access) or even no explicit compensation at all.

**Practical norm:** While unusual, zero-fee consultancy arrangements do occur in practice, particularly in:
- Strategic partnerships where the consultant gains market access or case studies
- Technology pilot programs where the consultant tests/develops products
- Startup ecosystems where equity, IP, or business development replaces cash

### Consultancy vs. Cooperation Agreement

| Aspect | Consultancy Agreement | Cooperation Agreement |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| IP default | Creator (consultant) retains | May imply joint ownership |
| Relationship | Service provider / client | Partners |
| Liability | Consultant liable for deliverables | Shared/allocated liability |
| Control | Client can direct work | Joint governance |
| Simplicity | Standard, well-understood | Requires more complex governance |
| Tax treatment | Service supply (VAT applies) | May be treated differently |

**The consultancy framing is advantageous** because it provides a cleaner IP ownership position and is a more familiar contract type for both parties' internal processes.

## 3. Alternative Framings

### Option A: Pure Consultancy Agreement (Recommended)

**Structure:** Regla provides consulting services (regulatory documentation, QMS automation strategy). OptoCeutics provides data access and domain expertise as "client cooperation" enabling the consulting work. No cash payment. Regla retains all IP in its platform.

**Pros:**
- Simplest framing, most familiar to both organizations
- IP retention is the legal default
- Looks like a normal consultancy to internal stakeholders
- Short, simple agreement (2 pages achievable)

**Cons:**
- Potential VAT exposure on barter value
- If challenged, substance shows co-development characteristics

### Option B: Technology Pilot Agreement

**Structure:** OptoCeutics serves as a pilot customer for Regla's platform. Regla develops its platform using OptoCeutics as a test environment. OptoCeutics gets free access during the pilot period.

**Pros:**
- Naturally explains why no money flows (it is a pilot/beta)
- Clearly positions Regla as the platform owner
- Common in tech industry

**Cons:**
- Less familiar framing for a medical device company
- May raise questions about why OptoCeutics is not paying after the pilot
- Implies Regla's platform is not yet market-ready

### Option C: Strategic Partnership with Consultancy Wrapper

**Structure:** A brief consultancy agreement with a "strategic partnership" preamble explaining the mutual benefit. The legal terms are consultancy; the narrative is partnership.

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds: simple legal structure, honest narrative
- The preamble can explain the no-payment rationale
- Still defaults to consultant-retains-IP

**Cons:**
- The preamble could be used as evidence of co-development intent if disputed

### Recommendation

**Option A (Pure Consultancy)** is the strongest framing for the stated goals. It looks most like a standard consultancy, is simplest, and best protects Regla's IP position. The recitals (baggrund) should briefly state that compensation is structured as IP retention and mutual knowledge exchange, rather than cash payment. This provides transparency without overcomplicating the document.

## 4. VAT and Tax Implications

### The Core VAT Risk: Barter Treatment

Under Danish VAT law (Momsloven) and EU VAT Directive Article 73, **barter transactions are taxable supplies**. When two businesses exchange services without cash, each party is technically making a supply for consideration (the consideration being the service received from the other party).

The Danish tax authority (Skattestyrelsen/SKAT) applies the **subjective value principle** for barter: the VAT base is the value of what is actually received in exchange.

### Specific SKAT Guidance on Barter (Byttehandel)

SKAT's guidance (D.A.8.1.1.10.2) confirms:
- The VAT base for barter is the **subjective value** of the consideration received
- This is the actually received consideration, not an objectively determined market value
- When neither party has a normal selling price for the exchanged services, the VAT base is the **production cost** of the service whose price can be established
- Both parties must charge 25% moms on the value of what they supply

### Practical VAT Scenarios

**Scenario 1: SKAT treats this as barter**
- Regla must charge 25% VAT on the market value of its consulting services
- OptoCeutics must charge 25% VAT on the market value of its data access/expertise
- Both can deduct the VAT charged by the other (assuming both are VAT-registered)
- **Net effect: Zero** if both are VAT-registered and using the services for taxable activities
- **Administrative burden:** Both need to issue invoices, report the VAT, and document the values

**Scenario 2: SKAT accepts the consultancy framing**
- If the agreement is structured as a consultancy with non-monetary compensation, the same barter analysis likely applies
- The framing (consultancy vs. cooperation) does not change the VAT treatment

**Scenario 3: Minimizing VAT exposure**
- If the agreement can genuinely be structured so that one party's contribution is not a "supply" but rather an internal activity that happens to benefit the other, the barter analysis might not apply
- For example, if OptoCeutics is merely providing access to its own systems (not actively performing services for Regla), and Regla is performing services for OptoCeutics, then only Regla is making a supply
- Regla's "consideration" would then need to be valued -- but if the agreement says the consideration is the right to retain IP and use the engagement for product development (i.e., Regla's own internal business benefit), the VAT picture becomes more favorable

### VAT Mitigation Strategy

**Recommended approach:** Frame the agreement so that:
1. Regla provides consulting services to OptoCeutics (this is Regla's supply)
2. OptoCeutics provides access to its systems and cooperates with Regla (this is client cooperation, not a counter-supply)
3. The "consideration" for Regla's services is described as the opportunity to develop and refine its own platform using real-world regulatory data -- i.e., Regla's business development interest
4. Avoid language suggesting OptoCeutics is providing a service to Regla in return

This framing positions the data access as **enabling conditions for the consultancy**, not as counter-consideration. It does not eliminate VAT risk entirely, but it provides a defensible position.

### Transfer Pricing Considerations

If Regla and OptoCeutics are not related parties (they are not), transfer pricing rules do not directly apply. However, SKAT's general anti-avoidance principle (realitetsgrundsaetning) could theoretically be invoked if the arrangement appears to have a tax avoidance motive. Since neither party benefits tax-wise from the zero-payment structure, this risk is minimal.

## 5. Source Code Access and Non-Compete

### Source Code Access in a Consultancy Context

Under Danish law, there is no prohibition against a consultancy agreement including a clause granting the client access to the consultant's source code. This is fundamentally a matter of **freedom of contract** (aftalefriheden). The key question is how this access is characterized:

| Characterization | Legal Implication |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **License** (internal use only) | Regla remains owner, OptoCeutics gets a limited right of use |
| **Escrow arrangement** | Source code held by third party, released on trigger events |
| **Transfer/assignment** | OptoCeutics becomes owner -- NOT what is intended here |

**Recommendation:** Frame source code access as a **limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license for internal use only**. This is the most common and well-understood structure. The license should explicitly state:
- The source code remains Regla's property
- OptoCeutics may use it only for internal purposes related to the consulting engagement
- No right to sublicense, modify for commercial distribution, or create derivative works for third parties
- The license terminates when the consultancy agreement terminates

### Recharacterization Risk: Consultancy vs. License Agreement

There is a risk that if the source code access provision is sufficiently prominent, the agreement could be recharacterized as a **software license agreement** rather than a consultancy. This matters because:
- License agreements may carry different VAT treatment
- License agreements create different expectations about ongoing support and maintenance
- The "consultancy" label becomes less credible if the primary deliverable is software access

**Mitigation:** Ensure the agreement clearly frames Regla's primary obligation as providing consulting services (analysis, recommendations, documentation, strategy). Source code access should be ancillary -- a tool used in connection with the consulting engagement, not the core deliverable.

### B2B Non-Compete Enforceability Under Danish Law

**Employment non-competes** (konkurrenceklausuler) are heavily regulated under the Act on Restrictive Employment Clauses (Lov om ansaettelsesklausuler), with a 12-month maximum duration and mandatory compensation requirements. However, these rules **do not apply to B2B commercial non-competes**.

**B2B non-competes** are governed by general contract law principles:
- Aftaleloven Section 36 (fairness review)
- General proportionality principles
- Competition law (Konkurrenceloven)

**Enforceability factors for B2B non-competes:**

| Factor | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **Duration** | Must be reasonable; 12-24 months is generally defensible; longer may be challenged |
| **Scope** | Must be clearly defined; "not compete in any way" is too broad; "not develop competing regulatory AI platform" is defensible |
| **Geographic scope** | Must relate to actual market; global scope is harder to defend than EU/Nordic |
| **Business justification** | Must protect a legitimate interest (IP, trade secrets, market position) |
| **Proportionality** | Restriction must be proportionate to the interest being protected |

**Recommendation for the agreement:**
- Non-compete duration: 24 months after termination (reasonable given source code access)
- Scope: OptoCeutics shall not use Regla's IP/source code to develop or procure a competing platform
- This is not a blanket non-compete on OptoCeutics' business -- it is specifically about not using Regla's technology to build a rival product
- Frame it as a **confidentiality and non-misuse obligation** rather than a pure non-compete, which is more naturally enforceable

## 6. Risk Analysis

### Risk 1: Recharacterization of Agreement (MEDIUM)

**The risk:** If a dispute arises, a Danish court could look beyond the "consultancy" label and determine the agreement is actually a cooperation/co-development agreement. Danish courts and tax authorities apply a **substance-over-form** approach (realitetsgrundsaetning).

**Why it matters:**
- A cooperation agreement may imply joint IP ownership
- Different liability allocation expectations
- Different termination consequences

**Indicators that would support recharacterization:**
- Both parties contributing substantive intellectual work to the same product
- Joint decision-making on product direction
- Shared risk and reward structure
- Equal participation in governance

**Indicators that support the consultancy framing:**
- Regla makes independent decisions about its platform
- OptoCeutics provides input but does not control development direction
- Regla bears all development risk
- OptoCeutics is a recipient of services, not a co-developer

**Mitigation:**
- Draft the agreement to emphasize the service-delivery relationship
- Avoid language suggesting joint ownership, shared governance, or co-development
- Ensure the operational reality matches the contract: Regla decides what to build, OptoCeutics provides feedback as a client would
- Do NOT include joint steering committees, shared roadmaps, or co-ownership provisions

### Risk 2: VAT Barter Exposure (MEDIUM-LOW)

**The risk:** SKAT treats the arrangement as a taxable barter and requires both parties to account for 25% VAT on the market value of their respective supplies.

**Impact:** Administrative burden (issuing invoices, reporting) but likely zero net cost since both parties can deduct input VAT. The risk is primarily one of non-compliance penalties if the barter is not reported, not of actual tax liability.

**Mitigation:** See Section 4 above. Frame OptoCeutics' cooperation as client-side enablement, not a counter-supply.

### Risk 3: Unfair Contract Challenge (LOW)

**The risk:** OptoCeutics later argues the agreement is unfair under Aftaleloven Section 36 because they provided valuable data and domain expertise but received "nothing" (no IP, no payment).

**Why this is LOW risk:**
- Danish courts are very restrained in applying Section 36 to B2B contracts
- OptoCeutics receives platform access and source code access -- tangible value
- Both parties are sophisticated commercial entities
- The arrangement was freely negotiated

### Risk 4: Employment/Contractor Misclassification (LOW)

**The risk:** If Regla personnel work extensively at OptoCeutics' premises under OptoCeutics' direction, there is a theoretical risk that the relationship could be recharacterized as employment rather than consultancy.

**Mitigation:**
- Regla works independently, using its own tools and methods
- No single-client dependency (though in practice there may be initially)
- Regla invoices (even at zero) as a business, not as an individual

### Risk 5: Source Code Exposure (NON-LEGAL, STRATEGIC)

**The risk:** Once OptoCeutics has source code access, they could theoretically replicate the technology despite contractual restrictions. Enforcement of a non-compete/non-misuse clause requires detecting the breach and litigating.

**Mitigation:**
- Strong contractual provisions with liquidated damages (konventionalbod)
- Limit source code access to specific components, not the entire platform
- Technical measures (access logging, limited environments)
- Consider source code escrow as an alternative to direct access

## 7. Practical Recommendations for Drafting

### Agreement Structure (Target: 2 Pages)

1. **Recitals (Baggrund)** -- 3-4 sentences explaining the context
   - Regla develops regulatory AI platform
   - OptoCeutics wishes to engage Regla for regulatory consulting services
   - Parties agree that compensation is structured through IP retention and mutual knowledge exchange rather than monetary payment

2. **Scope of Services** -- What Regla will do
   - Regulatory documentation consulting
   - QMS automation advisory
   - Regulatory strategy

3. **Client Cooperation** -- What OptoCeutics provides (framed as enabling the consultancy, not as counter-services)
   - Access to QMS systems and data
   - Domain expertise and practical feedback
   - Designated contact person

4. **Intellectual Property** -- Clear, simple
   - All IP in Regla's platform remains Regla's property
   - OptoCeutics receives a limited license for internal use during the agreement term
   - Source code access: limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, internal use only

5. **Confidentiality and Non-Misuse**
   - Mutual NDA
   - OptoCeutics shall not use Regla's IP to develop or procure competing solutions for [24] months after termination
   - Regla shall protect OptoCeutics' confidential QMS data

6. **Term and Termination**
   - Initial term: [12] months
   - Either party may terminate with [3] months' notice
   - IP and confidentiality provisions survive termination

7. **Governing Law and Disputes**
   - Danish law
   - Danish courts / Copenhagen City Court (or arbitration if preferred)

### Key Drafting Principles

- **Use "consulting services" language throughout**, not "co-development," "joint project," or "partnership"
- **Describe OptoCeutics' contributions as "client cooperation"** not as "services" or "deliverables"
- **Keep the IP clause simple and absolute**: Regla owns everything it develops, period
- **Frame non-compete as non-misuse**: OptoCeutics shall not misuse Regla's IP, rather than OptoCeutics shall not compete
- **Avoid governance structures**: No joint steering committee, no shared roadmap, no approval gates
- **State the no-payment arrangement explicitly**: Transparency is better than silence

---

## 8. Conclusion

**The consultancy framing is legally viable under Danish law.** The absence of monetary consideration does not invalidate the contract. The consultant-retains-IP structure is the legal default. The main risks (VAT barter treatment and potential recharacterization) are manageable through careful drafting.

**Recommended framing:** A straightforward consultancy agreement where Regla provides services, retains all IP, and where both parties acknowledge that the arrangement is structured through mutual benefit rather than cash payment. Source code access should be framed as an ancillary license, and the non-compete should be framed as a non-misuse obligation.

**Critical success factor:** The operational reality must match the contract. If Regla and OptoCeutics operate as equal co-development partners in practice, no amount of "consultancy" language in the contract will prevent recharacterization in a dispute. Regla should maintain its position as the independent service provider making autonomous decisions about its platform.
