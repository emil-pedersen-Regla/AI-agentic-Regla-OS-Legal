  <core_finding>
    Copyright alone is insufficient to protect against AI-assisted code rewriting under Danish/EU law.
    The CJEU has consistently held that software functionality is an unprotectable idea (SAS v. WPL, C-406/10).
    AI-rewritten code with different textual expression but equivalent functionality likely does not infringe copyright.
    Trade secret law plus contractual provisions provide the effective protection layer.
  </core_finding>

  <legal_analysis>
    <copyright_gap>
      Danish Copyright Act protects code expression only, not functionality or algorithms.
      Software Directive 2009/24/EC explicitly excludes ideas and principles underlying software.
      Sony v. Datel (CJEU C-159/23, 2024) reinforced code-centric view of software copyright.
      No CJEU or Danish ruling addresses AI-assisted reimplementation directly.
      Non-literal elements (architecture, structure) occupy a grey zone with uncertain protection.
    </copyright_gap>

    <trade_secret_strength>
      Danish Trade Secrets Act (Lov nr. 309/2018) implementing EU Directive 2016/943 provides strongest protection.
      Source code shared under NDA/license maintains trade secret status if reasonable secrecy measures exist.
      Using confidentially obtained code as AI input constitutes unlawful use regardless of output dissimilarity.
      Trade secret law protects against the PROCESS (feeding code into AI) not just the OUTPUT.
      Contractual restrictions can override statutory reverse engineering rights under the Directive.
      Favorable preliminary injunction conditions under Danish law (probable breach sufficient).
      Key limitation: six-month deadline from knowledge of misuse to initiate proceedings.

  <recommended_clauses>
    <clause type="essential" name="purpose_limitation">
      Restrict use to internal compliance operations only. Prohibit third-party product development.
    </clause>
    <clause type="essential" name="ai_restriction">
      Prohibit inputting code into AI tools for generating replacement or competing software.
      Restrict both the PROCESS (using AI on the code) and the OUTPUT (derivative works).
    </clause>
    <clause type="essential" name="derivative_works_definition">
      Expand definition to include code generated by AI tools that was produced using,
      trained on, prompted with, or informed by the Licensed Software.
    </clause>
    <clause type="essential" name="trade_secret_acknowledgment">
      Licensee acknowledges code as trade secret. Maintain at least same protection as own confidential information.
    </clause>
    <clause type="essential" name="survival_and_return">
      Confidentiality and use restrictions survive termination. Return/destruction obligation on all copies.
    </clause>
    <clause type="recommended" name="compliance_certification">
      Annual written certification of compliance with AI and use restrictions.
    </clause>
    <clause type="recommended" name="injunctive_relief">
      Parties acknowledge breach may cause irreparable harm, supporting injunction applications.
    </clause>
  </recommended_clauses>

  <risk_assessment>
    <risk_level>MEDIUM</risk_level>
    <rationale>
      OptoCeutics is a medical device company, not a software competitor.
      Good-faith commercial relationship reduces intentional misuse risk.
      Primary risk vector: code knowledge used for third-party products after relationship ends.
      AI tools make unintentional scope-creep in code reuse easier than before.
    </rationale>
  </risk_assessment>

  <enforcement_reality>
    Detection of AI rewriting is difficult but circumstantial evidence (timeline, functional
    equivalence, personnel overlap, architectural similarity) supports trade secret claims.
    Contractual provisions serve primarily as deterrent and negotiation leverage.
    Full litigation unlikely between good-faith Danish companies; settlement most probable outcome.
    Recommended Danish IP counsel: Gorrissen Federspiel, Kromann Reumert, Bird and Bird Copenhagen.
