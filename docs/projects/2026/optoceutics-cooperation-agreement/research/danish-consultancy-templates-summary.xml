<research_summary topic="Danish Consultancy Agreement Templates" date="2026-02-26">

  <key_finding>
    A standard Danish SME consultancy agreement (konsulentaftale) has 6-9 sections and fits on 2-3 pages.
    The universal sections are: Parties, Scope of Services, Compensation, Confidentiality, Termination, and Signatures.
    Danish law requires nothing formal - oral agreements are valid - but written agreements with these elements
    are standard business practice.

  <specific_answers>
    <liability>Mixed. Simplest templates omit it. Comprehensive ones include it. A 2-3 sentence clause
    is prudent but not universal. Danish default is unlimited fault-based liability when silent.</liability>
    <no_partnership>Handled via independent contractor clause, not as standalone Anglo-American provision.
    "Konsulenten er selvstaendig erhvervsdrivende" achieves same purpose in Danish practice.</no_partnership>
    <client_obligations>Yes, standard. Most templates include client's duty to provide access, information,
    and timely feedback.</client_obligations>
    <ip_consultant_retains>Default under Danish copyright law. Simple agreements often say nothing (default applies).
    Standard approach: brief statement that consultant retains IP, client gets use license.</ip_consultant_retains>
    <confidentiality>Embedded in agreement (not separate NDA). Typically 1-3 paragraphs. Mutual obligation,
    survives termination. Separate NDA only when information exchanged before agreement signed.</confidentiality>
    <non_compete>Rarely present in simple agreements. Legally sensitive in Denmark. Use restrictions
    (don't use our code for X) are even rarer and signal software licensing, not consultancy.</non_compete>

  <draft_v02_benchmark>
    <standard>Parties, Background A-B, Sections 1.1-1.3, 2.1-2.2, 4.1-4.3, 6.1-6.4, 7.1-7.2, Signatures</standard>
    <slightly_unusual>Background C (no-cash highlight), Section 1.4 (formal no-partnership), Sections 2.3-2.4
    (source code license), Section 4.4 (audit carve-out), Section 5 (liability cap), Section 7.3 (GDPR)</slightly_unusual>
    <stands_out>Section 3 (Use Restrictions) - most non-standard element. Reads like software license, not
    consultancy. AI rewriting prohibition (3.2) especially unusual. Section 2.5 (conditional license revocation)
    and Section 4.1 (explicit Trade Secrets Act reference) also signal legal sophistication beyond standard.</stands_out>
  </draft_v02_benchmark>

  <recommendations priority_ordered="true">
    <rec n="1">Remove or absorb Section 3 (Use Restrictions) into Section 2 as one sentence.
    This is the primary element making the agreement look like more than a consultancy.</rec>
    <rec n="2">Consolidate IP/License (Section 2) from 5 sub-sections to 2-3. Keep ownership,
    license grant, and non-distribution in compact form.</rec>
    <rec n="3">Shorten confidentiality from 5 to 3 sub-sections. Drop explicit Trade Secrets Act
    reference and regulatory audit carve-out.</rec>
    <rec n="4">Consider dropping Background C (explicit no-cash statement). Let the arrangement
    speak for itself through the services and consideration description.</rec>
    <rec n="5">Result: 6 sections, ~1.5-2 pages. Indistinguishable from any standard Danish
    consultancy agreement while retaining all core Regla protections.</rec>
