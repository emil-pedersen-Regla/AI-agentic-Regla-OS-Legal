## Background

A. Regla develops a proprietary AI-powered electronic Quality Management System (E-QMS) for medical device manufacturers, incorporating automated documentation generation, clinical and regulatory data analysis, and regulatory strategy support (the "Platform").

B. OptoCeutics engages Regla to provide consulting services related to quality management, regulatory documentation, and regulatory strategy, using and further developing the Platform.

C. No cash payment applies under this Agreement. Regla's consideration is the retention of all intellectual property in the Platform and access to OptoCeutics' QMS environment and domain expertise for Platform development. OptoCeutics' consideration is access to the Platform and its source code as described herein.

---

## 1. Services and Client Facilitation

1.1. Regla will provide consulting services to OptoCeutics using the Platform, including development, maintenance, and improvement of the Platform's functionality.

1.2. OptoCeutics will facilitate the consulting engagement by providing Regla with access to its QMS documentation, domain expertise, and practical feedback on Platform features.

1.3. Specific activities, timelines, and priorities will be agreed on an ongoing basis. Neither Party is obligated to commit a minimum number of hours or resources unless separately agreed in writing.

1.4. This Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, or any form of shared entity. Neither Party has authority to act on behalf of or bind the other.

## 2. Intellectual Property and Source Code License

2.1. Regla owns all intellectual property rights in the Platform, including any improvements, features, or functionality developed during or as a result of this engagement.

2.2. OptoCeutics retains all rights in its own QMS documentation, processes, and data.

2.3. Regla grants OptoCeutics a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Platform source code for OptoCeutics' own internal purposes, including in OptoCeutics' own products and services. This license does not include the right to distribute, sublicense, or make the source code available to third parties.

2.4. The source code license does not include the right to create derivative works for distribution to third parties, whether by modification, translation, adaptation, or reproduction through any means including automated code generation.

2.5. The source code license survives termination of this Agreement. However, the license terminates automatically if OptoCeutics breaches Section 3 (Use Restrictions) or Section 4 (Confidentiality).

## 3. Use Restrictions

3.1. OptoCeutics shall not use, incorporate, or derive from Regla's source code, intellectual property, or confidential information to develop, market, or distribute any product or service to third parties. This restriction applies during the Agreement and for twenty-four (24) months after termination.

3.2. OptoCeutics shall not input the Platform source code into artificial intelligence tools, large language models, or automated code generation systems for the purpose of creating software for distribution to third parties.

3.3. For the avoidance of doubt, OptoCeutics may freely use the Platform and source code for its own internal operations and in its own products and services, provided these are not marketed or distributed to third parties as competing E-QMS or regulatory compliance software derived from Regla's IP.

## 4. Confidentiality

4.1. Each Party shall keep confidential all non-public information received from the other Party ("Confidential Information"), including the Platform source code and the concepts, architecture, methodologies, and design patterns embodied therein. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party's Confidential Information constitutes trade secrets within the meaning of the Danish Trade Secrets Act (Lov om forretningshemmeligheder).

4.2. Confidential Information may be used solely for the purposes of this Agreement and disclosed only to employees and advisors bound by equivalent confidentiality obligations.

4.3. The confidentiality obligation does not apply to information that: (a) becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving Party; (b) was already known to the receiving Party; (c) is independently developed without use of the Confidential Information; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law, provided the disclosing Party is notified in advance where possible.

4.4. If either Party is subject to a regulatory audit or inspection (including by a Notified Body), the audited Party may disclose the existence and general nature of this engagement as necessary.

4.5. The obligations in this Section 4 survive termination for three (3) years.

## 5. Liability

5.1. Neither Party shall be liable for indirect or consequential losses, including loss of profit, loss of business, or loss of data.

5.2. Each Party's aggregate liability shall not exceed EUR 50,000, except in cases of gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or breach of Section 4 (Confidentiality).

## 6. Term and Termination

6.1. This Agreement enters into force on the date of signing and continues for an indefinite period.

6.2. Either Party may terminate for any reason by giving three (3) months' written notice.

6.3. Either Party may terminate with immediate effect if the other Party commits a material breach not remedied within thirty (30) days of written notice, or becomes insolvent.

6.4. Upon termination, the provisions of Sections 2 (IP and Source Code License), 3 (Use Restrictions), 4 (Confidentiality), and 5 (Liability) survive.

## 7. General Provisions

7.1. This Agreement is governed by Danish law. Disputes shall be settled by the ordinary Danish courts, with the Copenhagen City Court (Københavns Byret) as the court of first instance.

7.2. Amendments must be in writing and signed by both Parties. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties on the subject matter.

7.3. Each Party handles any personal data in accordance with applicable data protection legislation, including the GDPR. The Parties anticipate that QMS data shared under this Agreement will primarily consist of organisational and technical documentation.
