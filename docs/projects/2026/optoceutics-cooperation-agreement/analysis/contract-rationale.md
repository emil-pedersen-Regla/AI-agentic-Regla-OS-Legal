# Contract Rationale: Regla-OptoCeutics Cooperation Agreement

> **Purpose**: This document explains the reasoning behind every provision in the Cooperation Agreement (draft v01). It is intended to be shared with OptoCeutics as a transparency measure. If questions arise during negotiations, this document provides full traceability from each contract section to the rationale behind it.

## Our Guiding Philosophy

Before going into specific provisions, we want to be clear about the spirit behind this agreement:

**We genuinely want this co-development to work.** OptoCeutics is not just a client to us - you are the partner that will help us build something real. Your QMS, your expertise, your daily workflows - that is what transforms our technology from a prototype into a product that actually works for medical device companies.

We have drafted this agreement with three principles:

1. **Simplicity**: We are a 3-person startup. You are a 50-person company. Neither of us has time for 40-page contracts with complex legal mechanisms. This agreement is ~4 pages because that is all it needs to be.

2. **Fairness**: Every provision was designed to be fair to both sides. Where we had to make a judgment call, we asked: "Would we be comfortable if the roles were reversed?"

3. **Transparency**: We are sharing this rationale document because we have nothing to hide. Every decision is explained. If something does not sit right with you, let us talk about it.

## Section-by-Section Rationale

### Background (Recitals A-D)

**What it says**: Describes who we are, what we are doing together, and that this agreement covers both the cooperation and confidentiality.

**Why**: The background sets the context so that anyone reading the agreement (including a Notified Body auditor) immediately understands the nature of the relationship. We specifically mention that OptoCeutics contributes QMS access and expertise, and that Regla retains IP ownership, so these core terms are visible from the very first page.

**Traceability**: Recitals A, B, C, D.

### Section 1: Scope of Cooperation

**What it says**: Defines the three areas of co-development (QMS documentation, risk analysis, regulatory strategy) and clarifies that neither party is locked into specific time commitments.

**Why we wrote it this way**:

- **Section 1.1** lists the three development areas to give the cooperation clear direction without being overly prescriptive. We used "initial focus on" because priorities will naturally evolve as we learn what works.

- **Section 1.2** deliberately avoids minimum commitment requirements. We want both parties to contribute because they see value, not because a contract forces them to. Practical cooperation works better without rigid hour-tracking. That said, meaningful participation is expected from both sides (see Section 7.4(b) on what happens if participation drops off).

- **Section 1.3** explicitly states this is not a partnership, joint venture, or shared entity. Under Danish law, an unclear cooperation could be recharacterised as a partnership (I/S), which would create unlimited personal liability for both parties. This clause prevents that. It also means neither party can make commitments on behalf of the other.

**Traceability**: Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.

---

### Section 2: Contributions

**What it says**: Each party's role - Regla builds the platform, OptoCeutics provides QMS access and expertise. Each bears their own costs.

**Why we wrote it this way**:

- **Section 2.1** defines Regla's obligations: build the platform, incorporate feedback, provide access. These are concrete and measurable.

- **Section 2.2** defines OptoCeutics' obligations: grant QMS access, provide domain expertise, make personnel available. These are the contributions that make the co-development valuable and are the basis for the platform access rights in Section 3.

- **Section 2.3** states each party pays its own costs. No money changes hands. This keeps the relationship clean and avoids complex accounting. It also reflects reality - Regla invests development time, OptoCeutics invests expert time. Both contribute in kind.

**Traceability**: Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3.

---

### Section 3: Platform Access

**What it says**: OptoCeutics gets free platform access during the cooperation. Post-termination access depends on the circumstances (detailed in Section 7.4). Defines "Commercial Launch" as when the first paying customer starts using the platform.

**Why we wrote it this way**:

- **Section 3.1** grants free access during the cooperation, including updates. This is straightforward - while we are working together, OptoCeutics has full access to everything we build.

- **Section 3.2** references Section 7.4 for post-termination access rather than making a blanket perpetual promise here. The reason: we believe post-termination access should reflect the actual depth of the cooperation. A partner who cooperates for three years and a partner who cooperates for three months should not receive the same benefit. The graduated model in Section 7.4 ensures fairness for both sides.

- **Section 3.3** defines Commercial Launch because the 10-year access clock (Section 7.4(a)) starts from this date, not from signing or termination. This protects OptoCeutics: if the platform takes two years to develop before its first paying customer, those two years do not count against OptoCeutics' access period. The development phase - where OptoCeutics' contribution is most intense - is free regardless.

- **Section 3.4** makes the access non-transferable. This is standard - the access right is for OptoCeutics, not for a company that might acquire them and try to use it for a different purpose.

**Traceability**: Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4.

---

### Section 4: Intellectual Property

**What it says**: Regla owns all Platform IP. OptoCeutics keeps their own QMS and data. Feedback contributed by OptoCeutics becomes Regla's IP. Regla will not include OptoCeutics' identifiable information in versions sold to others.

**Why we wrote it this way**:

- **Section 4.1** assigns all Platform IP to Regla. This is the fundamental deal: Regla builds a product it can sell to other medical device companies. Without clean IP ownership, Regla cannot commercialise the platform, and the entire co-development loses its purpose.

- **Section 4.2** protects OptoCeutics by confirming that their QMS, processes, and data remain theirs. Helping us build a platform does not mean giving away your own intellectual property. This line is important for OptoCeutics' comfort.

- **Section 4.3** addresses the grey area: when OptoCeutics suggests a feature or gives feedback that we incorporate into the platform, that contribution becomes part of Regla's IP. The exchange is clear - ideas and feedback flow to Regla, platform access flows back to OptoCeutics. This is the deal.

- **Section 4.4** is a critical protection for OptoCeutics: we will never put your identifiable information into a version of the platform that competitors can see. The platform will contain generalised functionality only. Your specific QMS data, document templates, and processes stay confidential. What we learn from working with you will inform how we build features, but the features themselves will be generic.

**Traceability**: Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4.

---

### Section 5: Confidentiality

**What it says**: Mutual NDA. Both parties keep each other's information confidential. Standard exclusions. Audit carve-out for Notified Bodies. Survives 3 years after termination.

**Why we wrote it this way**:

- **Section 5.1** defines Confidential Information broadly and lists examples for each party. We chose a broad definition because in a close co-development, information flows naturally through conversations, shared screens, and working sessions. A narrow definition with marking requirements would be impractical and create gaps.

- **Section 5.2** limits use to cooperation purposes only. Straightforward.

- **Section 5.3** includes four standard exclusions that are universal in NDAs: public information, prior knowledge, independent development, and legal compulsion. These are non-controversial and necessary for the NDA to be workable.

- **Section 5.4** allows disclosure to employees and advisors who need to know. In practice, both companies will have team members involved in the cooperation. This clause lets them do their jobs while keeping the obligation in place through their own confidentiality commitments.

- **Section 5.5** is specifically designed for OptoCeutics' situation: when a Notified Body audits your QMS, the auditor may ask about external partnerships. This clause lets you confirm the cooperation exists and describe its general nature without disclosing confidential details. This is audit-readiness - the agreement should help your compliance, not create problems for it.

- **Section 5.6** sets a 3-year survival period. This is reasonable and proportionate. We considered longer periods, but 3 years post-termination is adequate protection without creating indefinite obligations for either side.

**Traceability**: Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6.

---

### Section 6: Data Handling

**What it says**: QMS data stays OptoCeutics' property. Regla can use it for platform development but not share identifiable data with third parties. Both parties follow GDPR. If personal data processing arises, we will agree on arrangements.

**Why we wrote it this way**:

- **Section 6.1** reaffirms data ownership. Even though Regla has access to QMS data for development purposes, the data belongs to OptoCeutics. This is a simple but important clarification.

- **Section 6.2** mirrors Section 4.4 but for data specifically. The point: your QMS data helps us build better features, but we never share your identifiable data with anyone else.

- **Section 6.3** acknowledges GDPR without over-engineering. The reality is that QMS data is primarily organisational and technical documentation (SOPs, templates, procedures). It does not typically contain personal data. We state this expectation plainly rather than building complex data processing frameworks for a problem that largely does not exist.

- **Section 6.4** is a safety net: if we do encounter personal data (e.g., employee names in document headers, clinical references), we will deal with it appropriately at that point. This keeps the agreement simple now without ignoring the possibility.

**Why we did not include a formal Data Processing Agreement**: A DPA under GDPR Article 28 would be required if Regla were processing personal data on behalf of OptoCeutics as a data processor. In this cooperation, Regla uses data for its own platform development purposes, and the data is overwhelmingly non-personal. A full DPA would be disproportionate and would mischaracterise the actual relationship.

**Traceability**: Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4.

---

### Section 7: Term and Termination

**What it says**: Indefinite term. Either party can leave with 3 months notice. Immediate termination for breach or insolvency. Post-termination platform access follows a graduated model based on cooperation duration and who initiated termination.

**Why we wrote it this way**:

- **Section 7.1** makes the agreement open-ended. We do not want an artificial end date forcing renewal negotiations. The cooperation continues as long as both parties see value in it.

- **Section 7.2** gives either party a clean exit with 3 months notice. No lock-in. Three months is enough time for an orderly wind-down without trapping either party in a cooperation that is not working.

- **Section 7.3** covers serious situations: if one party breaches the agreement and does not fix it within 30 days, or if one party becomes insolvent, the other can walk away immediately. The 30-day cure period is important - it gives the breaching party a chance to make things right before termination kicks in. Mistakes happen; what matters is whether they are fixed.

- **Section 7.4** is the heart of the access model. We designed it around one principle: **the party that stops holding up their end should not receive the premium benefit**. Here is the logic:

  **Section 7.4(a) - Full access for 10 years from Commercial Launch.** This is the reward for genuine partnership. It applies when:

  - *The cooperation lasted at least 2 years.* Two years of active co-development is a meaningful contribution. If OptoCeutics commits to this level of partnership, they deserve long-term access to the product they helped build. The 10-year clock starts from Commercial Launch, not from signing or termination, so the development phase does not count against it.

  - *Regla terminates for convenience.* If Regla is the one choosing to end the cooperation - for whatever reason - OptoCeutics should not be penalised for that. This protects OptoCeutics from a scenario where Regla walks away and takes the platform with it. Our message: if we end it, you are taken care of.

  - *Regla breaches the agreement.* Same logic - if Regla is at fault, OptoCeutics is made whole.

  **Section 7.4(b) - Frozen access (no updates).** This applies when OptoCeutics ends the cooperation early or fails to participate:

  - *OptoCeutics terminates before 2 years.* If OptoCeutics decides to walk away before the cooperation has had time to deliver real value, they keep the version of the platform that existed at that point, but not future development. This is fair - they contributed for a limited time, they get what was built during that time.

  - *OptoCeutics breaches, including non-participation.* If OptoCeutics stops providing QMS access, stops making personnel available, or otherwise disengages from the co-development, that is a material breach of Section 2.2. Regla can notify, give 30 days to cure, and if nothing changes, terminate. In this case, OptoCeutics gets the frozen version - not the premium deal. This protects Regla from a scenario where OptoCeutics cooperates briefly, then disengages while still expecting perpetual free access.

  **Why "frozen version" and not "no access at all"?** Because even in the less favourable scenario, OptoCeutics still contributed something during the cooperation period. Taking away all access would not be fair to the time and data they did invest. Frozen access is a proportionate middle ground.

  **Why 10 years and not perpetual?** Perpetual access to a commercially available platform is an enormous commitment. Ten years from Commercial Launch is generous - it is likely longer than the current version of the platform will be relevant - while giving Regla certainty that the obligation eventually ends. After 10 years, we can discuss continued access on commercial terms if both parties wish.

  **Why does the clock start at Commercial Launch?** Because the platform has no commercial value until it has paying customers. The co-development phase is an investment by both parties. Starting the clock at launch means OptoCeutics gets the full 10 years of benefit from a product that is actually on the market, not a product that is still being built.

- **Section 7.5** covers the practical aftermath of termination: return or delete confidential information, and confirm which sections survive. The surviving sections (Platform Access, IP, Confidentiality, Data Handling) are the ones that need to outlast the cooperation itself.

**Traceability**: Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4(a), 7.4(b), 7.5.

### Section 8: General Provisions

**What it says**: Danish law. Copenhagen courts. Written amendments. Email notices. Entire agreement. Severability.

**Why we wrote it this way**:

- **Section 8.1** chooses Danish law. Both parties are Danish. No reason to complicate things with foreign law.

- **Section 8.2** designates Copenhagen City Court. We considered arbitration but rejected it - arbitration fees are disproportionate for companies of our size. Danish courts are competent, accessible, and much cheaper. If we ever have a dispute (which we hope we will not), we want it resolved affordably.

- **Section 8.3** requires written amendments. This protects both parties from misunderstandings about verbal agreements. If we change the deal, we write it down and both sign.

- **Section 8.4** allows email notices. Practical for how we actually communicate. Physical mail is there as a fallback.

- **Section 8.5** makes this the entire agreement, superseding any prior discussions. This means neither party can later claim "but we also agreed to X in that meeting." Everything is in the document.

- **Section 8.6** is a standard severability clause. If a court finds one provision unenforceable, the rest of the agreement still stands. This is protective boilerplate that every agreement should have.

**Why we did not include**: liability caps, indemnification clauses, insurance requirements, force majeure, penalty provisions, or complex dispute escalation mechanisms. These are common in large corporate agreements, but they are disproportionate for a cooperation between a 3-person startup and a 50-person company. They add pages without adding practical value at our scale. Danish law already provides adequate default protections for both parties. If we tried to anticipate every possible scenario in the contract, we would end up with the kind of document that both our companies find unnecessarily complex.

**Traceability**: Sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6.

## Questions We Anticipate

**"Why does Regla keep all the IP?"**
Because Regla will sell the platform to other medical device companies. Without clean IP ownership, the product cannot be commercialised. OptoCeutics benefits through free access rather than IP ownership - this is a better deal for OptoCeutics, because they get the product without any of the development, maintenance, or commercialisation costs.

**"What if Regla sells our data to competitors?"**
Section 4.4 and Section 6.2 explicitly prohibit this. The platform will contain generalised functionality only. Your identifiable QMS data, templates, and processes are confidential and will never appear in any version accessible to third parties.

**"What happens if Regla gets acquired?"**
The agreement binds Regla and its successors. An acquirer would inherit both the obligations (including OptoCeutics' platform access rights) and the IP.

**"What if the platform never launches commercially?"**
During the cooperation, OptoCeutics has full access regardless. If the cooperation ends before Commercial Launch, the graduated access model in Section 7.4 still applies - but the 10-year clock for full access would start whenever the platform eventually launches.

**"Is this agreement enough for our Notified Body?"**
Section 5.5 specifically addresses this. You can disclose the existence and general nature of the cooperation during audits. The agreement is a clean, professional document that demonstrates a legitimate, well-structured partnership. Auditors expect to see documented agreements with external partners - this satisfies that expectation.

**"Why is the agreement so short?"**
Because both our companies believe in practical simplicity. A longer agreement would not make either party more protected - it would just cost more time to negotiate and maintain. Danish contract law provides strong default protections, and we have focused the written agreement on the things that matter: IP, confidentiality, access rights, and fair exit terms.
