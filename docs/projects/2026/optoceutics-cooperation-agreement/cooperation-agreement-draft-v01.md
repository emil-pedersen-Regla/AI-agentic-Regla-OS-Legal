## Background

A. Regla develops an AI-powered platform for medical device manufacturers that automates quality management and regulatory documentation, provides analytical capabilities across clinical and regulatory data, and supports regulatory strategy (the "Platform").

B. OptoCeutics is a medical device manufacturer that maintains a Quality Management System ("QMS") in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

C. The Parties wish to cooperate on the further development of the Platform. OptoCeutics will contribute access to its QMS, domain expertise, and practical feedback. In return, OptoCeutics will receive free, ongoing access to the Platform. Regla will retain ownership of all intellectual property in the Platform.

D. This Agreement sets out the terms of that cooperation, including confidentiality obligations binding on both Parties.

---

## 1. Scope of Cooperation

1.1. The Parties will cooperate on the development and improvement of the Platform, with initial focus on:

   (a) Automation of QMS documentation (SOPs, work instructions, quality records);

   (b) Risk analysis and post-market surveillance documentation; and

   (c) Regulatory strategy and submission documentation (longer-term).

1.2. The specific activities, timelines, and priorities will be agreed between the Parties on an ongoing basis through regular communication. Neither Party is obligated to commit a minimum number of hours or resources unless separately agreed in writing.

1.3. This Agreement does not create a partnership, joint venture, or any form of shared entity between the Parties. Neither Party has authority to act on behalf of or bind the other.

## 2. Contributions

2.1. **Regla** will:

   (a) Develop, maintain, and improve the Platform;

   (b) Incorporate feedback and insights from OptoCeutics into the Platform's general functionality; and

   (c) Provide OptoCeutics with access to the Platform as described in Section 3.

2.2. **OptoCeutics** will:

   (a) Grant Regla access to its QMS documentation, templates, and processes for the purpose of Platform development;

   (b) Provide domain expertise and practical feedback on Platform features; and

   (c) Make relevant personnel reasonably available for discussions and testing.

2.3. Each Party bears its own costs in connection with the cooperation unless otherwise agreed in writing.

## 3. Platform Access

3.1. During the term of this Agreement, Regla grants OptoCeutics free access to the Platform, including updates and new features as they become available. For the avoidance of doubt, this right of access applies to the Platform as described in the Background of this Agreement and does not extend to separate products or services that Regla may develop independently.

3.2. Upon termination of this Agreement, OptoCeutics' continued access to the Platform depends on the circumstances of termination, as set out in Section 7.

3.3. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Commercial Launch" means the date on which Regla first makes the Platform commercially available to a customer other than OptoCeutics under a paid agreement.

3.4. The right of access is granted to OptoCeutics and may not be transferred to third parties without Regla's prior written consent.

## 4. Intellectual Property

4.1. Regla owns all intellectual property rights in the Platform, including any improvements, features, or functionality developed during or as a result of this cooperation.

4.2. OptoCeutics retains all rights in its own QMS documentation, processes, and data. Nothing in this Agreement transfers ownership of OptoCeutics' existing intellectual property to Regla.

4.3. Where OptoCeutics contributes ideas, feedback, or suggestions that are incorporated into the Platform, OptoCeutics assigns any rights in such contributions to Regla. In return, OptoCeutics benefits from the Platform access described in Section 3.

4.4. Regla will not include OptoCeutics' identifiable confidential information in any version of the Platform made available to third parties. The Platform will contain only generalised functionality and features.

## 5. Confidentiality

5.1. Each Party undertakes to keep confidential all non-public information received from the other Party in connection with this cooperation ("Confidential Information"). This includes, but is not limited to:

   - For Regla: Platform technology, source code, algorithms, business plans, and pricing;
   - For OptoCeutics: QMS documentation, internal processes, product data, and business information.

5.2. Each Party may use the other Party's Confidential Information solely for the purposes of this cooperation and the activities described in this Agreement.

5.3. The confidentiality obligation does not apply to information that:

   (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the receiving Party;

   (b) was already known to the receiving Party before disclosure;

   (c) is independently developed by the receiving Party without use of the Confidential Information; or

   (d) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court order, provided the disclosing Party is notified in advance where possible.

5.4. Each Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees and advisors who need to know the information for the purposes of the cooperation, provided they are bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section 5.

5.5. If either Party is subject to a regulatory audit or inspection (including by a Notified Body), the audited Party may disclose the existence and general nature of this cooperation as necessary to satisfy the audit. The audited Party shall not disclose the other Party's Confidential Information beyond what is strictly required.

5.6. The obligations in this Section 5 survive termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.

## 6. Data Handling

6.1. OptoCeutics' QMS data shared with Regla under this Agreement remains the property of OptoCeutics.

6.2. Regla may use the QMS data to develop, test, and improve the Platform. Regla shall not share OptoCeutics' identifiable QMS data with third parties.

6.3. Each Party will handle any personal data in accordance with applicable data protection legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679). The Parties anticipate that the QMS data shared under this Agreement will primarily consist of organisational and technical documentation and will not typically contain personal data.

6.4. If the cooperation involves processing personal data, the Parties will agree on appropriate arrangements in accordance with applicable law.

## 7. Term and Termination

7.1. This Agreement enters into force on the date of signing and continues for an indefinite period.

7.2. Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason by giving three (3) months' written notice to the other Party.

7.3. Either Party may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect by written notice if the other Party:

   (a) commits a material breach of this Agreement that is not remedied within thirty (30) days of written notice specifying the breach; or

   (b) becomes insolvent, enters into liquidation, or ceases to carry on business.

7.4. **Post-termination Platform access.** The level of Platform access OptoCeutics receives after termination depends on the duration and circumstances of the cooperation:

   (a) **Full access with updates (10 years from Commercial Launch):** OptoCeutics retains free access to the Platform, including updates and new features within the scope described in the Background of this Agreement, for a period of ten (10) years from the Commercial Launch date (as defined in Section 3.3). This applies if:

   - the cooperation has lasted at least two (2) years at the time of termination; or

   - Regla terminates for convenience under Section 7.2 (regardless of how long the cooperation has lasted); or

   - the termination is due to a material breach by Regla under Section 7.3.

   After the 10-year period, Regla and OptoCeutics may agree on continued access on commercial terms. Platform access under this Section is subject to reasonable usage levels consistent with OptoCeutics' own business needs.

   (b) **Frozen access (no updates):** OptoCeutics retains free access to the version of the Platform as it exists at the date of termination, but is not entitled to future updates, new features, or improvements. This applies if:

   - OptoCeutics terminates for convenience under Section 7.2 before two (2) years of cooperation; or

   - the termination is due to a material breach by OptoCeutics under Section 7.3, including a sustained failure to participate in the cooperation as described in Section 2.2.

7.5. Upon termination:

   (a) Each Party shall return or, at the disclosing Party's option, delete the other Party's Confidential Information within a reasonable time, except to the extent retention is required by law or regulation;

   (b) The provisions of Sections 3 (Platform Access), 4 (Intellectual Property), 5 (Confidentiality), 6 (Data Handling), and 8 (Liability) survive termination.

## 8. Liability

8.1. Neither Party shall be liable to the other for any indirect or consequential losses arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including but not limited to loss of profit, loss of business, or loss of data.

8.2. Each Party's total aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed EUR 50,000 (fifty thousand euros), except in cases of gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

8.3. The limitation in Section 8.2 does not apply to breaches of the confidentiality obligations in Section 5.

## 9. General Provisions

9.1. **Governing law.** This Agreement is governed by Danish law.

9.2. **Disputes.** Any dispute arising from this Agreement shall be settled by the ordinary Danish courts, with the Copenhagen City Court (Københavns Byret) as the court of first instance.

9.3. **Amendments.** Amendments to this Agreement must be made in writing and signed by both Parties.

9.4. **Notices.** Written notices under this Agreement shall be sent by email to the addresses notified by each Party, or by physical mail to the addresses stated above.

9.5. **Entire agreement.** This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the cooperation described herein and supersedes all prior discussions, understandings, and agreements on the subject matter.

9.6. **Severability.** If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
