# Detailed Risk Assessment: Shareholder Agreement
**Date:** November 7, 2025
**Document:** MW Draft Shareholder Agreement - Regla ApS
**Analysis:** Clause-by-Clause Risk Evaluation

---

## Risk Classification System

- **🔴 CRITICAL:** Could result in loss of company control, catastrophic financial liability, or fundamental threat to founder interests
- **🟠 HIGH:** Significant financial exposure or unfavorable terms unusual for market
- **🟡 MEDIUM:** Standard but improvable terms; negotiation recommended
- **🟢 LOW:** Minor concerns; standard market terms
- **✅ FAVORABLE:** Terms that benefit founders

---

## CRITICAL RISKS (🔴) - Immediate Action Required

### 🔴 RISK #1: Vesting Period Undefined and Likely Extended

**SA Clause:** 14.1 - Vesting Period marked as **[•]** (blank)
**MW Note:** Footnote 5 states "we normally see 48 month vesting period"

**FA Terms:**
- "All equity will vest over a **two-year period** with a one-year cliff"
- Page 2, Section 2.2

**Risk Analysis:**
- **If 48 months adopted:** Vesting period DOUBLES from 2 years to 4 years
- **Financial Impact at €10M exit:**
  - FA (2 years): Fully vested at 2 years = €3.33M
  - SA (4 years): Only 50% vested at 2 years = €1.67M at risk
  - **Founder Loss:** €1.67M exposure to good/bad leaver provisions

**Why This Matters:**
- Standard market is 4 years, but **you already agreed to 2 years in FA**
- Changing negotiated terms without consideration is unfavorable
- Longer vesting = more risk exposure to termination scenarios

**Strategic Impact:**
- Reduces founder flexibility to exit or transition roles
- Increases investor control over longer timeframe
- Contradicts FA principle of "share rewards with everyone"

**Recommendation:** **REJECT 4-year vesting. Demand 2-year term per FA.**

---

### 🔴 RISK #2: Vesting Start Date Undefined - Loss of Credit

**SA Clause:** 14.1 - Start date marked as **[•]** (blank)

**FA Terms:**
- **Emil:** "Vesting began on 15 of August 2024"
- **Anton:** "Vesting begins on April 1 2025"
- **Yuri:** "Vesting begins on April 1 2025"
- Page 1, Section 2.2

**Risk Analysis:**
- **Time Elapsed Since Emil's Start:** ~15 months (Aug 2024 → Nov 2025)
- **If vesting resets to SA signing date:** Emil loses all vesting credit
- **If 2-year vesting:** Emil has earned ~62.5% vesting credit
- **If 4-year vesting:** Emil has earned ~31.25% vesting credit

**Financial Impact (€10M exit scenario):**
- **Emil's 33.33% = €3.33M**
- **15 months credit @ 2-year vest = €2.08M vested**
- **15 months credit @ 4-year vest = €1.04M vested**
- **If reset to zero:** €1.04M - €2.08M at immediate risk

**Why This Matters:**
- Emil has been working full-time as CEO for 15 months
- All work to date (business development, AI development, fundraising) deserves vesting credit
- Resetting to zero is economically unjust and contradicts FA

**Recommendation:** **DEMAND vesting start dates per FA:**
- Emil: August 15, 2024
- Anton: April 1, 2025
- Yuri: April 1, 2025

---

### 🔴 RISK #3: Bad Leaver Provision - Total Loss at Par Value

**SA Clause:** 14.4 - "In the event of a Bad Leaver situation, the Company... is entitled... to purchase up to all shares of the relevant Party at par value."

**FA Terms:** No bad leaver provision mentioned

**Bad Leaver Definition (SA Clause 1.1):**
- Company terminates for material breach (including rightful dismissal/"bortvisning")
- Key Person terminates without Company's material breach
- **[OPTION highlighted]:** Termination within Cliff Period for ANY reason

**Risk Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: Termination for "Material Breach"**
- Term "material breach" is vague and could be interpreted broadly
- Could include: missing deadlines, disagreements on strategy, performance issues
- Even if you've worked 3.5 years of 4-year vesting (87.5% vested), you lose EVERYTHING

**Scenario 2: You Quit Without Company Breach**
- If burned out, want to pursue other opportunities, or have personal reasons to leave
- Even with shares 100% vested economically, you lose them at par value
- Company worth €10M, your 33.33% = €3.33M, you receive DKK 6,668 (€895)

**Scenario 3: "Bortvisning" (Rightful Dismissal)**
- Danish employment law allows summary dismissal for serious misconduct
- Standard bar: Theft, violence, serious insubordination, criminal acts
- BUT "material breach" could be interpreted more broadly in shareholder context
- Risk of dispute over whether conduct qualifies

**Market Comparison:**
- **Standard Market (Investors):** Bad leaver = unvested shares buyback at par OR nominal value
- **Standard Market (Investors):** Vested shares retained OR bought at fair market value
- **This SA:** ALL shares (vested + unvested) at par value
- **Assessment:** This provision is **extremely investor-favorable** and **extremely founder-unfavorable**

**Financial Impact Examples:**

| Company Value | Your 33.33% Value | Par Value Buyback | Your Loss |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| €3M | €1M | €895 | €999,105 (99.9%) |
| €10M | €3.33M | €895 | €3,329,105 (99.97%) |
| €50M | €16.67M | €895 | €16,669,105 (99.995%) |

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates massive downside risk even after years of successful work
- "Material breach" is subjective and could lead to disputes
- Disproportionate penalty - lose millions for relatively minor issues
- Eliminates economic value of vested shares earned through years of work

**Recommendation:** **REJECT bad leaver applies to vested shares.**

**Counter-Proposal:**
- **Bad Leaver = unvested shares only** at par value
- **Vested shares:** Founder keeps OR Company buys at fair market value
- **Alternative:** Sliding scale discount (e.g., 25% discount for bad leaver on vested shares)

---

### 🔴 RISK #4: Hiring Requires Unanimous Consent

**SA Clause:** 6.1(ix) - Material decisions requiring ALL Parties consent include: "hiring of new employees"

**FA Terms:** Not restricted; CEO responsible for operations

**Risk Analysis:**

**Operational Impact:**
- Any co-founder can block ANY hire at ANY level
- Cannot hire developer, salesperson, operations manager without unanimous approval
- Even intern or contractor could require unanimous vote

**Startup Reality:**
- Early-stage startups need hiring agility
- Talent windows are narrow - good candidates get other offers quickly
- Unanimous consent creates delays and potential deadlock

**Deadlock Scenarios:**
- Co-founder disagrees on candidate quality
- Co-founder wants different role prioritized
- Co-founder has personal conflict with candidate
- Co-founder traveling/unavailable when decision needed

**Strategic Impact:**
- Severely constrains CEO's ability to execute business plan
- Investors will view this negatively (operational paralysis risk)
- Could prevent scaling even with funding in place

**Market Comparison:**
- **Standard:** Hiring thresholds based on salary/seniority (e.g., unanimous for C-level or >€100K)
- **This SA:** Unanimous for ALL hires (even interns)
- **Assessment:** Extremely restrictive; **unusual and unfavorable**

**Recommendation:** **REJECT unanimous consent for all hiring.**

**Counter-Proposals:**
1. **Threshold approach:** Unanimous consent only for:
   - Executive Management positions
   - Roles with salary >€100,000/year
   - Roles with >2% equity grants

2. **CEO authority:** CEO can hire with simple majority approval (2 of 3 founders)

3. **Budget approach:** CEO has hiring authority within approved annual budget

---

### 🔴 RISK #5: Non-Compete Wrong Industry (Copy-Paste Error)

**SA Clause:** 18.1 - "...refrain from... for a period of 12 months... become a shareholder or advisor in any business that develops, provides and/or distributes products, services or technology within **alcohol free wine**."

**Company's Actual Business (FA):**
"Regla is being developed to automate the preparation of compliance documentation required for operating a software-as-a-medical-device company in Denmark and the EU."

**Risk Analysis:**

**Immediate Problem:**
- Non-compete is **completely wrong industry**
- You could immediately start competing medical device compliance business after leaving
- Martin apparently copy-pasted from different client agreement

**What This Reveals:**
- **Quality concern:** Document not properly customized
- **Attention to detail:** Critical provisions not reviewed
- **Template usage:** Raises question about other uncustomized terms

**Competitive Risk If Not Fixed:**
- After leaving, founders could:
  - Start competing med device compliance automation company
  - Join competing company
  - Advise competing company
- No legal restriction because non-compete says "alcohol free wine"

**Investor Perspective:**
- Future investors will catch this error
- Reduces confidence in legal documentation quality
- May require expensive re-documentation

**Recommendation:** **Demand correction AND full document review.**

**Correct Language:**
"...any business that develops, provides and/or distributes products, services or technology within **medical device regulatory compliance, clinical evaluation documentation, or software-as-a-medical-device compliance automation**."

**Strategic Action:**
- Explicitly raise this error with Martin
- Request confirmation that entire SA has been reviewed for similar issues
- Consider whether Martin's attention to detail is sufficient for this critical document

---

### 🔴 RISK #6: CEO Tiebreaker Authority Removed

**SA Clauses:**
- 4.3: "All resolutions at general meetings shall be passed by a simple majority, unless another majority is required"
- 6.1: Material decisions require consent of "all Parties"
- No tiebreaker mechanism mentioned

**FA Terms:**
- "All major decisions shall be determined by a majority vote of the founders"
- "In the event that no majority consensus is reached... the CEO shall have the final decision-making authority"
- "If two-thirds of the founders vote against the CEO's position, that majority decision shall prevail"
- Section 5.1

**Risk Analysis:**

**Control Shift:**
- **FA:** CEO has tiebreaker, overridable by 2/3 supermajority
- **SA:** No tiebreaker; unanimity required for material decisions
- **Result:** Any single founder can block material decisions

**Operational Impact:**

**Deadlock Scenarios:**
| Decision Type | FA Outcome | SA Outcome |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| 2-1 vote (CEO in majority) | CEO position wins | Deadlock (requires unanimity) |
| 2-1 vote (CEO in minority) | Majority wins | Deadlock (requires unanimity) |
| 1-1-1 split | CEO breaks tie | Deadlock (no mechanism) |

**Material Decisions Subject to Deadlock (Clause 6.1):**
- Amendments to articles (cannot adapt to business changes)
- Dividends (cannot return capital to shareholders)
- Merger/IPO (cannot execute exit)
- Debt >50k DKK (~€6,700) - very low threshold
- Expenses >50k DKK - operational constraint
- Hiring employees - growth constraint
- Litigation/settlements - legal strategy paralyzed

**Why This Matters:**
- **CEO role requires operational authority**
- **Deadlock = paralysis** for early-stage startup
- **Investor concern:** Decision-making structure unclear
- **Day-to-day operations affected:** Can't make expenses >€6,700 or hire anyone without unanimity

**Strategic Impact:**
- Reduces Emil's effectiveness as CEO
- Any co-founder can hold company hostage
- Investors will view governance structure as risky

**Market Comparison:**
- **Standard 3-founder:** CEO tiebreaker OR qualified majority (2 of 3)
- **This SA:** Unanimity for material decisions
- **Assessment:** Unusually restrictive; **founder-unfavorable**

**Recommendation:** **REJECT unanimity requirement.**

**Counter-Proposals:**
1. **Restore FA tiebreaker:** CEO breaks deadlock, overridable by 2/3
2. **Qualified majority:** 2 of 3 founders for material decisions
3. **Hybrid:** Unanimity for extraordinary matters (IPO, sale, liquidation); qualified majority for operational matters (hiring, expenses)

---

### 🔴 RISK #7: Dual-Class Share Structure Omitted

**SA Terms:**
- Clause 4.2: "Each share shall have one vote"
- No mention of dual-class structure or enhanced voting rights

**FA Terms:**
- Section 11: "Dual-Class Share Structure (Founders' Enhanced Voting Rights)"
- "The founders intend to pursue a dual-class share structure in which shares held by the founders... will carry enhanced voting rights"
- "This structure is designed to safeguard the long-term vision and strategic direction"
- "It remains a **strategic priority** to maintain the autonomy necessary to execute our vision"

**Risk Analysis:**

**What Dual-Class Achieves:**
- Founders maintain voting control even after dilutive funding rounds
- Protects against hostile takeover or investor override
- Standard in tech companies (Google, Facebook, Snap, etc.)

**Loss of Dual-Class:**
- After funding rounds, founders' voting power = economic ownership%
- Example: After raising €2M at €8M pre-money valuation:
  - Investors own 20%
  - Founders diluted to 80% total (26.67% each)
  - With dual-class: Founders could retain 51%+ voting control
  - Without dual-class: Founders have only 80% voting (investors have blocking minority)

**Why FA Called This "Strategic Priority":**
- Enables founders to execute long-term vision without investor interference
- Prevents short-term pressure to sell or change strategy
- Standard practice for founder-led companies

**Why Omitted from SA:**
- Dual-class typically implemented at first institutional funding round
- May be reasonable to address later, BUT:
  - Should be stated as intent in SA
  - SA is opportunity to preserve founder rights pre-investment
  - Harder to implement after investors involved

**Strategic Impact:**
- Founders lose negotiating leverage for dual-class post-investment
- Early angel investors get standard shares (harder to convert later)
- Signals lack of founder control protection

**Recommendation:** **Include dual-class intent or implementation plan.**

**Counter-Proposals:**
1. **Add clause:** "The Parties intend to implement a dual-class share structure with enhanced voting rights for Founder Shares prior to or concurrent with the first institutional investment round."

2. **Implement now:** Create Class A (founder shares, 10 votes each) and Class B (standard shares, 1 vote each) structure immediately

3. **Minimum:** Add provision allowing conversion to dual-class with qualified majority vote

---

### 🔴 RISK #8: Unanimous Consent for Material Decisions

**SA Clause:** 6.1 - "The following decisions... shall require the prior written consent of all Parties"

**FA Terms:** "All major decisions shall be determined by a majority vote" (Section 5.1)

**Material Decisions Requiring Unanimity (Summary):**

| Category | Specific Items | Risk Level |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Governance** | Articles amendments, merger, IPO, liquidation | Medium (appropriate) |
| **Financial** | Dividends, debt >50k, loans >50k, guarantees >50k | High (too restrictive) |
| **Operational** | Expenses >50k, hiring ALL employees | **Critical** (paralysis risk) |
| **Legal** | Litigation, settlements | High (delays) |
| **Strategic** | Asset sales, IP licensing | Medium (appropriate) |

**Analysis by Decision Type:**

**1. Expenses >50,000 DKK (~€6,700)**
- **Too Low for Startup Operations:**
  - Office lease: ~€2,000/month = €24,000/year (okay)
  - Senior developer salary: €60,000/year (**blocks hiring**)
  - AWS/cloud infrastructure: Can exceed €6,700/year
  - Marketing campaign: €10,000 (blocked)
  - Legal fees: This SA review probably cost >€6,700 (would have been blocked!)

- **Creates Operational Bottleneck:**
  - CEO cannot make routine business decisions
  - Must get unanimous approval for common expenses
  - Delays can cause lost opportunities

**2. Debt >50,000 DKK (~€6,700)**
- **Too Low for Normal Business:**
  - Bridge loan before funding: Blocked
  - Equipment financing: Blocked
  - Credit line for working capital: Blocked
  - Even SMALL operational debt requires unanimity

**3. Hiring ALL Employees** (covered in Risk #4)

**4. Litigation/Settlements**
- **Business Reality:**
  - Sometimes must sue to enforce contracts
  - Sometimes must settle to avoid costs
  - Unanimity requirement allows any founder to block legal strategy

- **Example Scenarios:**
  - Customer refuses to pay €50,000 invoice → Cannot sue without unanimity
  - Former employee threatens baseless lawsuit → Cannot settle without unanimity
  - Supplier breach causes damages → Cannot pursue claim without unanimity

**Why This Matters:**
- **Converts SA from founder agreement to VETO RIGHTS agreement**
- Each founder becomes de facto dictator over ANY material decision
- **Deadlock = company paralysis**

**Market Comparison:**
- **Standard 3-Founder:** Majority (2 of 3) for most decisions; supermajority (unanimous or 2/3) only for extraordinary matters
- **Extraordinary matters:** Sale of company, IPO, liquidation, major amendments
- **Operational matters:** Qualified majority sufficient
- **This SA:** Unanimous for EVERYTHING material
- **Assessment:** **Extremely unusual and operationally risky**

**Recommendation:** **Negotiate tiered decision-making structure.**

**Counter-Proposal:**

| Decision Category | Voting Requirement | Examples |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Extraordinary** | Unanimous (all 3) | Sale of company, IPO, liquidation, dissolution |
| **Strategic** | Qualified majority (2 of 3) | Amendments, debt >€100K, asset sales, major IP licenses |
| **Operational** | CEO authority or simple majority | Hiring (within budget), expenses <€100K, litigation <€50K |
| **Routine** | CEO authority | Day-to-day operations, expenses within approved budget |

### 🔴 RISK #9: Cliff Period Bad Leaver Option

**SA Clause:** 1.1 Definition of "Bad Leaver" - includes highlighted bracketed text:
"[(iii) the Key Person's Company Relationship has been terminated within the Cliff Period, notwithstanding the reason hereof]"

**MW Note:** Footnote 1 asks "Please confirm if one (1) year cliff period shall apply"

**Risk Analysis:**

**If This Provision Adopted:**
- **ANY termination within first 12 months = Bad Leaver**
- Applies regardless of reason:
  - Company terminates you without cause
  - Mutual agreement to part ways
  - Medical leave or disability
  - Company breach forcing you to quit
  - **EVEN: Company's fault**

**Combined with Bad Leaver Consequence:**
- All shares purchased at par value (DKK 6,668 = €895)
- No economic benefit from work during cliff period

**Scenarios Where You Lose Everything:**

1. **Company Breach:**
   - Company doesn't pay salary for 3 months
   - You rightfully terminate employment
   - Month 11 of cliff period
   - **Result:** You're "bad leaver," lose all shares at par value

2. **Mutual Agreement:**
   - All founders agree company isn't working
   - Amicable decision to wind down at month 9
   - **Result:** You're "bad leaver," lose all shares at par value

3. **Investors Force Change:**
   - Get funding month 10
   - Investors want experienced CEO
   - You agree to step down
   - **Result:** You're "bad leaver," lose all shares at par value

4. **Health/Personal:**
   - Serious illness month 8
   - Cannot continue working
   - **Result:** You're "bad leaver," lose all shares at par value

**Why This Matters:**
- **Eliminates ALL protection during cliff period**
- Standard cliff: No vesting if leave before 12 months (lose unvested shares)
- This cliff: Lose ALL shares (including those that would have vested) at par value
- **Creates massive injustice** for Company-caused terminations

**Market Comparison:**
- **Standard cliff:** No vesting occurs until 12 months; if leave before cliff, get zero shares
- **This provision:** Lose shares at par value (essentially zero) EVEN if termination is Company's fault
- **Assessment:** **Extremely unusual and unjust**

**Recommendation:** **REJECT automatic bad leaver status within cliff.**

**Counter-Proposal:**
- **Standard cliff treatment:** No vesting before 12 months; if leave voluntarily or terminated for cause, receive zero shares (standard forfeiture)
- **Company-fault protection:** If Company terminates without cause within cliff, founder receives pro-rated shares at fair market value OR nominal value (not par)
- **Mutual exit:** If all founders agree to wind down, no bad leaver treatment

---

## HIGH PRIORITY RISKS (🟠) - Should Negotiate Strongly

### 🟠 RISK #10: Good Leaver Loses Unvested Shares at Par Value

**SA Clause:** 14.5 - "In the event of a Good Leaver situation, the Company... is entitled... to purchase all unvested shares... at par value. For the avoidance of doubt the relevant Party shall keep all vested shares."

**Risk Analysis:**

**Good Leaver Definition:**
- Company Relationship terminated AND
- Not a Bad Leaver (i.e., no material breach, no voluntary quit)

**Good Leaver Scenarios:**
- Company terminates without cause (budget cuts, strategy change)
- Mutual agreement to part ways
- Role change (step down from executive role)

**Financial Impact (4-year vesting, €10M exit):**

| Time of Exit | Vested % | Unvested % | Value Vested | Value Lost (Unvested at Par) |
|--------------|----------|------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| 18 months | 37.5% | 62.5% | €1.25M (keep) | €2.08M (lose ~€2.08M) |
| 24 months | 50% | 50% | €1.67M (keep) | €1.67M (lose ~€1.67M) |
| 36 months | 75% | 25% | €2.5M (keep) | €833K (lose ~€833K) |

**Why This Matters:**
- Vesting is meant to reward time contributed to company
- Good leaver = no fault termination
- Par value (~€895 for unvested portion) provides zero economic benefit
- Disincentivizes founders from leaving even if Company wants them to go

**Market Comparison:**
- **Investor-Favorable:** Unvested shares at par value (this SA)
- **Founder-Friendly:** Unvested shares at fair market value
- **Market Standard:** Unvested shares at par OR time-prorated fair market value
- **Assessment:** This SA is standard but **could be negotiated to be more favorable**

**Why You Should Negotiate:**
- You're pre-investment (no investors forcing terms yet)
- Good leaver = Company's choice to terminate
- Founders deserve some economic benefit for time contributed even if unvested

**Recommendation:** **Negotiate partial fair market value for unvested shares.**

**Counter-Proposals:**
1. **Time-Prorated FMV:** If good leaver after cliff, unvested shares bought at:
   - Time worked / Vesting period × Fair Market Value
   - Example: Leave at 30 months of 48-month vest = 62.5% earned
   - 37.5% unvested, but worked 62.5% of period
   - Receive: (30/48) × FMV of unvested shares = 62.5% × FMV

2. **Minimum Value Floor:** Unvested shares bought at greater of:
   - Par value, OR
   - Book value per share, OR
   - 25% of fair market value

3. **Vesting Credit:** Accelerate portion of unvested shares based on time served
   - Example: After 2 years, accelerate 6 additional months of vesting upon good leaver exit

---

### 🟠 RISK #11: Breach Penalty - 50% Discount on Forced Sale

**SA Clause:** 17.3 - "The purchase price shall be determined in accordance with clauses 13.3 and 13.4 less 50.00 %."

**Context:** If Party materially breaches SA and doesn't cure within 14 days, other Parties can force purchase at fair market value MINUS 50%.

**Risk Analysis:**

**Material Breach Under SA:**
- Clause 17.1: "material breach of its obligations under this Shareholders' Agreement"
- Could include:
  - Miss information provision deadline
  - Fail to attend general meeting
  - Breach confidentiality (even minor disclosure)
  - Breach non-compete
  - Indirect ownership change without consent
  - Transfer shares without following procedure

**Not All Breaches Are Egregious:**
- **Minor procedural breach:** Forget to notify Executive Management within required timeframe
- **Good faith error:** Disclose confidential info to advisor thinking they were covered by exception
- **Disputed interpretation:** Disagree on whether action constitutes "material breach"

**Financial Impact:**

| Company FMV | Your 33.33% | Forced Sale at 50% Discount | Your Loss |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------|
| €5M | €1.67M | €835K | €835K (50%) |
| €10M | €3.33M | €1.67M | €1.67M (50%) |
| €20M | €6.67M | €3.33M | €3.33M (50%) |

**Why This Matters:**
- **50% discount is extremely punitive**
- Applies to ALL shares (vested and unvested)
- No distinction between minor and major breaches
- Creates risk of weaponization: Other founders could claim "breach" to force discounted buyout

**Market Comparison:**
- **Standard:** Breach = damages calculated based on actual harm caused
- **Alternative:** Breach = forced sale at fair market value (no discount) plus damages
- **Aggressive:** 10-25% discount on forced sale
- **This SA:** 50% discount
- **Assessment:** **Very punitive; unusually harsh**

**Recommendation:** **Negotiate reduction or removal of discount.**

**Counter-Proposals:**
1. **Remove discount:** Breach = forced sale at FMV + damages for actual harm
2. **Reduce discount:** 25% discount maximum
3. **Tiered penalties:**
   - Minor breach (procedural): 10% discount
   - Moderate breach (confidentiality): 25% discount
   - Major breach (competition, fraud): 50% discount
4. **Cure period extension:** 30 days to cure (not 14 days)

---

### 🟠 RISK #12: No ESOP Mentioned

**SA:** No mention of Employee Stock Option Plan

**FA Terms:**
- Section 10: "Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)"
- "Regla will reserve 10% of its fully diluted shares for an Employee Stock Option Plan"
- "This pool is intended to attract, retain, and reward key employees and advisors"

**Risk Analysis:**

**Why ESOP Matters:**
- Early employees expect equity compensation
- Competitive necessity to attract talent
- 10% is standard reservation

**Impact of Omission:**
- **Dilution Uncertainty:** Where does 10% come from?
- **Founder Dilution:** If ESOP created later, founders could be diluted from current 33.33% each
- **Investor Expectation:** Investors will expect ESOP; better to establish pre-investment

**Dilution Math:**

**Scenario 1: ESOP from Founder Shares (Post-Hoc)**
- Current: 33.33% each founder = 100%
- Create 10% ESOP: Founders diluted to 30% each = 90% total
- **Each founder loses:** 3.33 percentage points

**Scenario 2: ESOP Reserved Now**
- Founders: 30% each = 90%
- ESOP: 10% reserved
- **Clear from start; no surprise dilution**

**Why This Should Be in SA:**
- Clarifies dilution expectations
- Shows alignment with FA
- Demonstrates commitment to team equity participation

**Recommendation:** **Add ESOP clause to SA.**

**Proposed Language:**
"The Parties agree that the Company shall establish an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) reserving ten percent (10%) of the Company's fully diluted share capital for grants to employees, advisors, and service providers, on terms to be determined by the Executive Management and approved by a Qualified Majority."

---

### 🟠 RISK #13: No Differentiated Vesting Start Dates

**SA Clause:** 14.1 - Single vesting start date "[•]" for all Parties

**FA Terms:**
- Emil: August 15, 2024
- Anton: April 1, 2025
- Yuri: April 1, 2025

**Risk Analysis:**

**Work Contributions Different:**
- Emil started August 2024 (15 months ago)
- Anton/Yuri starting April 2025 (future date per FA)
- Equal treatment ignores different contribution timelines

**Economic Justice:**
- Emil has 8 months head start over Anton/Yuri
- If SA uses single date, Emil either:
  - **Option A:** Loses 8 months credit (if SA date used)
  - **Option B:** Anton/Yuri get retroactive credit they didn't earn (if Aug 2024 used)

**FA Intent:**
- FA explicitly recognized different start dates
- Reflected actual work commencement
- SA should preserve this distinction

**Impact on Vesting:**

**Example: 4-year vesting, €10M exit at 36 months from SA signing**

| Founder | FA Start Date | Vesting Credit | % Vested at Exit | Economic Value |
|---------|---------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Emil (correct)** | Aug 15, 2024 | 36 + 15 = 51 months | 100% (>48 months) | €3.33M |
| **Emil (if reset)** | SA date | 36 months | 75% | €2.5M (-€833K) |
| **Anton/Yuri** | Apr 1, 2025 | 36 - 5 = 31 months | 65% | €2.17M |

**Recommendation:** **Demand differentiated vesting start dates per FA.**

---

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (🟡) - Note for Discussion

### 🟡 RISK #14: Confidentiality Penalty May Be Reasonable

**SA Clause:** 20.5 - "In case of a Party's... breach of its obligations under this clause 20, the Party... in breach shall... pay to the Company an agreed penalty in the amount of DKK 250,000."

**Analysis:**
- DKK 250,000 ≈ €33,500
- For confidentiality breach (one-time payment)
- Plus damages under Danish law
- Plus injunction available

**Assessment:**
- Confidentiality is critical for startup (IP protection, competitive advantage)
- DKK 250k is meaningful but not catastrophic
- Comparable to 3-4 months of senior salary
- **Verdict:** Probably reasonable; LOW priority to negotiate

---

### 🟡 RISK #15: Non-Solicitation Penalty

**SA Clause:** 18.5 - "...pay to the Company an agreed penalty in the amount of DKK 250,000 to be paid each calendar month the breach persists."

**Analysis:**
- DKK 250,000/month for non-solicitation breach (customer or employee)
- Ongoing penalty while breach continues
- Plus damages and injunction available

**Assessment:**
- Monthly penalty creates strong deterrent
- Non-solicitation is reasonable protection for company
- DKK 250k/month is substantial but justified for ongoing competitive harm
- **Verdict:** Acceptable; LOW priority

### 🟡 RISK #16: 12-Month Non-Compete Duration

**SA Clause:** 18.1 - 12 months after leaving

**Market Comparison:**
- **Denmark:** Non-competes must be reasonable in scope, duration, geography
- **Standard:** 6-12 months common
- **Assessment:** 12 months is upper end but defensible if properly scoped (AFTER fixing industry error)

**Negotiation Option:**
- Reduce to 6 months, OR
- Make compensation-dependent (Company pays salary during non-compete), OR
- Accept 12 months IF industry scope properly narrowed

## FAVORABLE TERMS (✅) - Maintain These

### ✅ POSITIVE #1: Single Trigger Acceleration

**SA Clause:** 14.7 - "All of each Party's shares shall automatically be deemed vested upon an Exit (i.e. single trigger acceleration)."

**FA Terms:** "In the event of a company sale or a liquidity event, acceleration provisions may be triggered as further negotiated."

**Why This Is Good:**
- **Single trigger:** Shares vest automatically upon acquisition/exit
- **Protects founders from acquirer termination:** Acquirer can't fire you immediately post-deal to claw back unvested shares
- **Better than FA:** FA left this "to be negotiated"; SA provides automatic protection

**How It Works:**
- Company acquired at month 30 of 48-month vesting
- Without acceleration: 62.5% vested, 37.5% unvested at risk
- With single trigger: 100% vests immediately upon acquisition
- Even if acquirer terminates you next day, you keep all shares

**Market Context:**
- **Single trigger:** Founder-friendly (this SA)
- **Double trigger:** More common in investor-led deals (vest only if acquired AND terminated)
- **No acceleration:** Investor-favorable (rare)

**Recommendation:** **KEEP THIS PROVISION.** Don't trade it away in negotiations.

### ✅ POSITIVE #2: Drag-Along at 2/3 Threshold

**SA Clause:** 12.1 - "In the event that Parties representing a Qualified Majority [2 out of 3]... wish to carry out an Exit, such Parties shall have the right to oblige all other shareholders... to consent to the transaction and to sell..."

**FA Terms:** Section 9.3 - "...at least two-thirds (2/3) of the founders approve the sale, the remaining founder(s) shall be required to sell..."

**Why This Is Good:**
- **Aligned with FA:** Both require 2/3 (2 of 3 founders)
- **Prevents minority blocking:** One founder can't block exit wanted by others
- **Balanced:** Not simple majority (too easy to force) or unanimous (too easy to block)

**How It Works:**
- If 2 founders want to accept acquisition offer, 3rd must also sell
- Minority founder gets same per-share price and terms as majority
- Enables exits without unanimous agreement

**Market Context:**
- **Standard range:** 50.1% (simple majority) to 75% (supermajority)
- **This SA:** 66.67% (2 of 3)
- **Assessment:** Standard and fair

**MW Note:** Footnote 3 asks "please consider if this should require the consent of all parties"
**Recommendation:** **REJECT unanimous requirement. KEEP 2/3 threshold per FA.**
