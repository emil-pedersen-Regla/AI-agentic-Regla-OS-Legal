## DECISION 1: Founder Vesting Structure

### The Question
**What vesting schedule should apply to founder shares?**

### Context
- Vesting demonstrates commitment to investors
- Standard structure is 4 years with 1-year cliff
- Determines when founders fully own their equity
- Affects downside risk if founders depart

### Options

#### □ Option A: 4-Year with 1-Year Cliff (MARKET STANDARD)

**Structure:**
- 0% vests until 12-month anniversary (cliff)
- 25% vests at 12-month cliff
- Remaining 75% vests monthly over next 36 months
- Fully vested at 48 months

**Pros:**
- Universal investor expectation (>95% of startups)
- Signals strong founder commitment
- No investor questions or pushback
- Cliff protects company from very early departures

**Cons:**
- Founders at risk if terminated in year 1 (lose everything)
- Full 4-year earn-out period

**Financial Impact:**
- If terminated at month 11: Lose 100% of equity
- If terminated at month 30: Keep 62.5% (vested), lose 37.5% (unvested)

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★★★ (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option B: 3-Year with 6-Month Cliff (FOUNDER-FAVORABLE)

**Structure:**
- 0% vests until 6-month anniversary
- ~17% vests at 6-month cliff
- Monthly vesting thereafter
- Fully vested at 36 months

**Pros:**
- Shorter total vesting period
- Faster full ownership
- Smaller cliff risk window

**Cons:**
- Unusual (investors may question commitment)
- Deviates from market standard
- May require justification (e.g., repeat founder track record)

**Financial Impact:**
- Fully vested 1 year earlier than standard
- Lower year-1 risk (6 months vs 12 months)

**Recommendation Level:** ★★☆☆☆ (NOT RECOMMENDED unless exceptional circumstances)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option C: No Vesting (100% Immediate)

**Structure:**
- All shares vest immediately upon issuance
- No cliff, no earn-out

**Pros:**
- Maximum founder protection
- No risk of losing shares

**Cons:**
- Major investor red flag
- Will require renegotiation at Series A
- Co-founder risk (founder leaves with full equity)
- Signals lack of commitment

**Financial Impact:**
- Founders own 100% of equity immediately
- But: Will be forced to accept vesting in Series A anyway

**Recommendation Level:** ★☆☆☆☆ (NOT RECOMMENDED - creates future problems)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

## DECISION 2: Vesting Acceleration Terms

### The Question
**What acceleration should apply if founders are terminated after an acquisition?**

### Context
- Acceleration protects founders from post-acquisition termination without shares
- Two types: Single-trigger (acquisition alone) vs Double-trigger (acquisition + termination)
- Affects founder economics and acquirer attractiveness
- Balance: founder protection vs acquirer concerns

### Options

#### □ Option A: 100% Double-Trigger Acceleration (RECOMMENDED)

**Structure:**
- Requires BOTH: (1) Acquisition AND (2) Termination without cause
- If both occur within 12 months, 100% of unvested shares vest immediately
- Termination without cause OR resignation for good reason qualifies

**Pros:**
- Maximum founder protection
- Acquirer retains control (triggers only if they terminate)
- Retention incentive remains (founders want to stay)
- Fair outcome (if terminated, founders benefit from value they built)

**Cons:**
- Some acquirers may resist 100% (prefer 75% or 50%)
- Slightly reduces acquirer cost flexibility

**Financial Impact Example:**
- Acquisition at month 24: Founder has 50% vested (500K shares)
- Founder terminated post-acquisition
- 100% acceleration: Remaining 500K shares vest → Walk away with 1M shares
- At €10/share: Worth €10M (vs €5M without acceleration)

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★★★ (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option B: 75% Double-Trigger Acceleration (COMPROMISE)

**Structure:**
- Same triggers as Option A
- 75% of unvested shares vest (not 100%)

**Pros:**
- Strong founder protection (75% is substantial)
- More acquirer-friendly than 100%
- Common compromise

**Cons:**
- Founders lose 25% of unvested value if terminated
- Less protection than 100%

**Financial Impact Example:**
- Same scenario: 500K unvested at acquisition
- 75% acceleration: 375K shares vest (125K forfeited)
- At €10/share: Worth €8.75M (vs €10M with 100%)

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★★☆ (ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option C: 50% Double-Trigger Acceleration (ACQUIRER-FAVORABLE)

**Structure:**
- Same triggers
- 50% of unvested shares vest

**Pros:**
- Provides some protection (better than nothing)
- Acquirer-friendly
- Maintains stronger retention incentive

**Cons:**
- Founders lose half of unvested value
- Weaker protection

**Financial Impact Example:**
- 50% acceleration: 250K shares vest (250K forfeited)
- At €10/share: Worth €7.5M (vs €10M with 100%)

**Recommendation Level:** ★★☆☆☆ (ACCEPTABLE if necessary, not preferred)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option D: No Acceleration

**Structure:**
- Acquisition does not trigger any acceleration
- Vesting continues on original schedule regardless of termination

**Pros:**
- Maximum acquirer-friendliness
- Strongest retention incentive

**Cons:**
- Zero founder protection
- Founders can be terminated and lose all unvested shares
- Unfair: Founders build value for acquirer, get terminated, receive nothing for unvested

**Financial Impact Example:**
- Acquisition at month 24, termination: Founder walks away with only 500K vested shares
- Loses 500K unvested shares (€5M at €10/share)

**Recommendation Level:** ★☆☆☆☆ (NOT RECOMMENDED - too risky for founders)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

### Trade-Off Summary

| Factor | 100% Double-Trigger | 75% Double-Trigger | 50% Double-Trigger | No Acceleration |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Founder Protection | Excellent | Good | Moderate | None |
| Acquirer Appeal | Good | Better | Excellent | Excellent |
| Fairness | High | High | Moderate | Low |
| Retention Incentive | Moderate | Moderate | Strong | Strongest |
| Market Prevalence | Common | Very Common | Less Common | Rare |

### Your Final Decision

**Selected Option:** [ ] A [ ] B [ ] C [ ] D

**Percentage:** ______% (if choosing acceleration)

**Trigger Window:** ______ months (standard: 12 months)

## DECISION 3: Liquidation Preference Structure

### The Question
**What liquidation preference should investors receive in an exit?**

### Context
- Liquidation preference determines investor payout priority in acquisition/liquidation
- Two dimensions: Multiple (1x, 1.5x, 2x) and Participation (participating vs non-participating)
- Directly affects founder economics in all exit scenarios
- Nordic standard: 1x non-participating

### Options

#### □ Option A: 1x Non-Participating (NORDIC STANDARD - RECOMMENDED)

**Structure:**
- Investor receives 1x their investment amount OR pro-rata share (whichever is greater)
- Investor chooses one, not both

**Example (€2M investment for 20%, €10M exit):**
- Option 1: Take 1x preference = €2M
- Option 2: Take pro-rata (20% of €10M) = €2M
- Investor chooses either: €2M (20%)
- Founders receive: €8M (80%)

**Pros:**
- Nordic market standard (78% of Series A)
- Founder-friendly economics
- Aligns incentives (both benefit from higher valuations)
- Investor protected in downside scenarios

**Cons:**
- None (this IS the standard)

**Financial Impact Across Exit Values:**
| Exit Value | Investor Gets | Founders Get | Founder % |
|------------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| €3M | €2M (67%) | €1M (33%) | 33% |
| €5M | €2M (40%) | €3M (60%) | 60% |
| €10M | €2M (20%) | €8M (80%) | 80% |
| €20M | €4M (20%) | €16M (80%) | 80% |

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★★★ (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option B: 1x Participating (INVESTOR-FAVORABLE)

**Structure:**
- Investor receives 1x investment amount PLUS pro-rata share of remainder ("double dip")

**Example (€2M investment for 20%, €10M exit):**
- Preference: €2M (gets first)
- Pro-rata of remaining €8M: €1.6M (20%)
- Investor total: €3.6M (36%)
- Founders receive: €6.4M (64%)

**Pros:**
- Investor gets enhanced downside protection
- More investor-favorable

**Cons:**
- Reduces founder payouts by 10-20% across all scenarios
- Creates misaligned incentives
- Less common in Nordic markets

**Financial Impact:**
| Exit Value | Investor Gets | Founders Get | Founder Loss vs Option A |
|------------|---------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| €5M | €2.6M (52%) | €2.4M (48%) | -€600K (-20%) |
| €10M | €3.6M (36%) | €6.4M (64%) | -€1.6M (-20%) |
| €20M | €5.6M (28%) | €14.4M (72%) | -€1.6M (-10%) |

**Recommendation Level:** ★★☆☆☆ (AVOID if possible)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option C: 1x Participating with 3x Cap (COMPROMISE)

**Structure:**
- Investor participates (double dip) but capped at 3x return
- After investor receives 3x investment, founders get remainder

**Example (€2M investment, €20M exit):**
- Preference: €2M
- Participation: Up to €4M more (to reach 3x cap of €6M)
- Investor total: €6M (30%)
- Founders receive: €14M (70%)

**Pros:**
- Limits "double dip" damage
- More acceptable to founders than uncapped participating

**Cons:**
- Still reduces founder economics vs non-participating
- More complex

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★☆☆ (ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE if investor insists on participating)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

### Trade-Off Summary

| Factor | 1x Non-Participating | 1x Participating | 1x Part. w/ 3x Cap |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Founder Economics | Excellent | Poor | Moderate |
| Investor Protection | Good | Excellent | Excellent |
| Incentive Alignment | High | Low | Moderate |
| Nordic Market Standard | Yes (78%) | No (declining) | Uncommon |
| Complexity | Simple | Simple | Moderate |

### Your Final Decision

**Selected Option:** [ ] A [ ] B [ ] C

**Rationale:**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**Red Line:** Will NOT accept participating without cap [ ] Yes [ ] No

**Fallback Position:**

## DECISION 4: Drag-Along Threshold

### The Question
**What percentage of shareholders should be able to force all others to sell in an acquisition?**

### Context
- Drag-along prevents minority from blocking beneficial sales
- But: too low threshold allows investor + 1 founder to force sale against majority founder will
- Nordic standard: 75-80%
- At Regla (post-Series A): Founders 70%, Investor 30%

### Options

#### □ Option A: 75% Threshold (RECOMMENDED - BALANCED)

**Structure:**
- Requires 75% of shareholders to approve sale, then all must sell

**At Regla's 70% founder / 30% investor structure:**
- Investor (30%) + 2 of 3 founders (≥45%) = Can drag
- All 3 founders (70%) + no investor = Can drag
- 1 founder + investor = CANNOT drag (only 50-55%)

**Pros:**
- Nordic market standard
- Prevents minority from forcing sale
- Requires founder majority OR broad consensus
- Balanced protection

**Cons:**
- Requires significant consensus (can slow down beneficial transactions)

**Control Impact:**
- Emil + Anton + Investor = 30% + 25% + 25% = 80% → CAN drag Yuri
- Emil + Investor = 30% + 25% = 55% → CANNOT drag others

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★★★ (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option B: 80% Threshold (MORE FOUNDER-PROTECTIVE)

**Structure:**
- Requires 80% to drag

**At Regla:**
- Requires investor + 2 significant founders OR nearly all 3 founders
- Higher bar for forced sale

**Pros:**
- Even more founder protection
- Requires very broad consensus

**Cons:**
- Harder to execute beneficial transactions
- Less common (slight deviation from 75% standard)

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★★☆ (ACCEPTABLE, slightly more protective than needed)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

#### □ Option C: 60% Threshold (INVESTOR-FAVORABLE)

**Structure:**
- Requires 60% to drag

**At Regla:**
- Investor (30%) + 1 founder (25%) = 55% → Need investor + Yuri (30% + 20% = 50% still not enough)
- Investor (30%) + Anton or Emil (25%) = 55% → Still short
- Actually at Regla: Still requires 2 founders + investor OR all 3 founders

**But in future rounds with more investor dilution:**
- At 40% investor ownership: Investor + 1 founder (20%) = 60% → CAN force sale

**Pros:**
- Easier to execute transactions (lower threshold)
- More investor-friendly

**Cons:**
- Weaker founder protection
- Could allow minority to force sale in future
- Below Nordic standard

**Recommendation Level:** ★★☆☆☆ (NOT RECOMMENDED - too low)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

**Rationale:** _________________________________________

---

### Trade-Off Summary

| Factor | 75% Threshold | 80% Threshold | 60% Threshold |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Founder Protection | Good | Excellent | Weak |
| Transaction Efficiency | Good | Moderate | Excellent |
| Nordic Market Standard | Yes (prevailing) | Common | Below standard |
| Minority Blocking Risk | Low | Very Low | Higher |

### Your Final Decision

**Selected Option:** [ ] A (75%) [ ] B (80%) [ ] C (60%) [ ] Other: ____%

**Rationale:**
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**Red Line:** Will NOT accept threshold below: _____%

**Fallback Position:**

## DECISION 5: Board Composition Evolution

### The Question
**How should the board be structured pre-investment and post-Series A?**

### Options Summary Table

| Structure | Pre-Series A | Post-Series A | Founder Control |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Option A** (Recommended) | 2 founders + 1 independent | 2 founders + 2 investors + 1 independent | Balanced |
| **Option B** (Founder-Favorable) | 3 founders | 3 founders + 2 investors | Founder majority |
| **Option C** (Investor-Favorable) | 2 founders + 1 independent | 2 founders + 3 investors | Investor majority |

---

#### □ Option A: 2F + 1I → 2F + 2INV + 1I (RECOMMENDED)

**Pre-Series A:**
- 2 founder directors (Emil + 1 co-founder OR Emil + rotating)
- 1 independent director

**Post-Series A:**
- 2 founder directors
- 2 investor directors
- 1 independent director (tiebreaker)

**Pros:**
- Nordic market standard for Series A
- Balanced power (neither side controls)
- Independent provides objective perspective
- Scales naturally (3 → 5)
- Professional governance structure

**Cons:**
- Founders lose board majority at Series A
- Independent director becomes "kingmaker"

**Decision Scenarios:**
- Founders + Independent = 3/5 (60%) → Approve
- Investors + Independent = 3/5 (60%) → Approve
- Independent is tiebreaker on 2-2 splits

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★★★ (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

---

#### □ Option B: 3F → 3F + 2INV (FOUNDER-CONTROLLED)

**Pre-Series A:**
- 3 founder directors (Emil, Anton, Yuri)

**Post-Series A:**
- 3 founder directors
- 2 investor directors

**Pros:**
- All founders have board seat (voice)
- Founders maintain majority (60% of board)

**Cons:**
- Investors may resist minority position at Series A
- Large pre-Series A board (3 people for small startup)
- Dilutes individual founder influence

**Recommendation Level:** ★★★☆☆ (ACCEPTABLE if investors accept minority)

**Your Decision:** [ ] Select this option

---

### Your Final Decision

**Pre-Series A Structure:**
- Number of directors: [ ] 2 [ ] 3 [ ] 5 [ ] Other: ____

# SECTION 3: TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS WORKSHEETS

## Worksheet 1: Founder Protection vs Investor Appeal

**Trade-Off:** Stronger founder protection often means less investor appeal (and vice versa)

### Your Positions

For each factor, mark where you're willing to be on the spectrum:

**Vesting Protection:**
```
Founder-Protective ←————————————————————————→ Investor-Favorable
No vesting          3yr/6mo cliff    4yr/1yr cliff    5yr vesting
                         ↑                  ↑
                    Mark your          Mark your
                    preferred        acceptable
                    position          fallback
```

**Liquidation Preference:**
```
Founder-Protective ←————————————————————————→ Investor-Favorable
No preference     1x non-part.    1x part w/ cap   2x participating
      ↑                ↑
```

**Drag-Along Threshold:**
```
Founder-Protective ←————————————————————————→ Investor-Favorable
100% (unanimous)    80%      75%      66.7%    60%    50%
                     ↑        ↑
```

**Board Control:**
```
Founder-Protective ←————————————————————————→ Investor-Favorable
Founder majority   Balanced   Investor majority   Investor super-majority
      ↑             ↑
```

**Reserved Matters:**
```
Founder-Protective ←————————————————————————→ Investor-Favorable
Minimal list     Standard list   Extensive list   Unanimous everything
                     ↑
```

### Analysis

**Where are you most founder-protective?** (What matters most to you?)
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**Where can you be more investor-friendly?** (What can you compromise?)
_________________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

**Overall Balance:** Is your package reasonable? Too founder-protective? Too investor-favorable?
_________________________________________________________________

## Worksheet 2: Economics vs Control Trade-Offs

**Question:** If forced to choose, would you prioritize economics (money in exit) or control (decision-making power)?

### Scenario A: High Economics, Low Control

**Package:**
- 1x non-participating liquidation preference (excellent economics)
- 75% drag-along (founder protection)
- BUT: Investor board majority at Series A
- BUT: Extensive reserved matters (investor veto on many decisions)

**Outcome:**
- You make more money in exit
- But investors control many major decisions
- You operate with oversight

**Would you accept this?** [ ] Yes [ ] No [ ] Maybe

---

### Scenario B: Moderate Economics, High Control

**Package:**
- 1x participating liquidation preference (worse economics, -15% in typical exits)
- 75% drag-along
- BUT: Founder board majority maintained at Series A
- Minimal reserved matters (operational flexibility)

**Outcome:**
