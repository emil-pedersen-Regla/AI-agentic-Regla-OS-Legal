## Financial Impact Examples

### Bad Leaver Loss (Company Value: €10M, Emil's 33.33% = €3.33M)

| Scenario | Current SA Treatment | Loss to Emil |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|
| Terminated for "material breach" after 3 years | ALL shares bought at par (€895) | €3,329,105 (99.97%) |
| Quits to pursue other opportunity (100% vested) | ALL shares bought at par (€895) | €3,329,105 (99.97%) |

### Vesting Period Extension (Exit at 3 years, €10M valuation)

| Vesting Term | % Vested at Exit | Value at Risk | Emil's Payout |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| FA: 2 years | 100% (fully vested) | €0 | €3.33M |
| SA: 4 years | 75% | €833K at risk | €2.5M (-€833K) |

### Vesting Start Date Reset (€10M exit at 4 years from SA signing)

| Start Date | Vesting Credit | % Vested | Emil's Payout |
|------------|----------------|----------|---------------|
| FA: Aug 15, 2024 | 48 + 15 = 63 months | 100% | €3.33M |
| SA: Signing date (reset) | 48 months | 100% | €3.33M |
| **Emil's Loss** | **-15 months credit** | **0% difference at 4yr** | **BUT massive risk if exit earlier** |

**Early Exit Impact (€10M exit at 2.5 years from SA signing):**
- FA start (Aug 2024): 2.5yr + 1.25yr = 45 months = 94% vested = €3.13M
- SA start (reset): 30 months = 63% vested = €2.08M
- **Loss: €1.05M**

## Decision-Making Comparison

### FA Decision Framework:
- **Majority vote** for major decisions
- **CEO tiebreaker** in deadlock
- **2/3 override** of CEO if needed

**Example Outcomes:**
| Vote Split | FA Result |
|------------|-----------|
| 2-1 (CEO in majority) | CEO position wins |
| 2-1 (CEO in minority) | Majority wins |
| 1-1-1 | CEO breaks tie |
| 3-0 against CEO | CEO overridden |

### SA Decision Framework:
- **Unanimity** required for material decisions
- **No tiebreaker** mechanism
- **Any party veto** blocks decision

**Example Outcomes:**
| Vote Split | SA Result |
|------------|-----------|
| 2-1 (any direction) | DEADLOCK |
| 1-1-1 | DEADLOCK |
| 3-0 | Passes |

### Material Decisions Requiring Unanimity (SA Clause 6.1):
1. Articles amendments
2. Dividends
3. Merger/IPO/listing
4. Liquidation/bankruptcy
5. Debt >50k DKK (~€6,700)
6. Loans/guarantees >50k DKK
7. Asset/IP sales
8. Expenses >50k DKK (one-off)
9. **Hiring ANY employee**
10. Litigation/settlements

**RESULT: Operational paralysis risk**

## Non-Negotiable Must-Haves

Emil's red lines for signing:

1. ✅ **2-year vesting** (not 4 years)
2. ✅ **Emil start date: Aug 15, 2024** (not reset)
3. ✅ **Bad leaver = unvested shares only** (not all shares)
4. ✅ **FMV for vested shares** (not par value for all)
5. ✅ **Fix non-compete industry** (medical devices, not wine)
6. ✅ **Hiring threshold or qualified majority** (not unanimity for all hires)
7. ✅ **CEO tiebreaker OR qualified majority** (not pure unanimity)
8. ✅ **Dual-class intent stated** (or implementation plan)
9. ✅ **Unanimous material decisions list reduced** (or thresholds raised)

---

## Negotiation Priorities

### Phase 1: Must-Fix (Will Not Sign Without)
1. Vesting period → 24 months
2. Vesting start dates → Per FA (Emil: Aug 2024)
3. Bad leaver scope → Unvested only
4. Hiring authority → Threshold or 2/3
5. Non-compete → Fix industry error
6. CEO control → Restore tiebreaker or 2/3 qualified majority
7. Dual-class → Add intent provision
8. Material decisions → Reduce unanimity list or raise thresholds
9. Cliff bad leaver → Do not include

### Phase 2: Strongly Negotiate
10. Good leaver → Time-prorated FMV for unvested
11. Breach penalty → Reduce to 25% or remove
12. ESOP → Add 10% reservation
13. Differentiated dates → (Covered in #2)

### Phase 3: Accept If Needed
- Confidentiality penalties (reasonable)
- Non-solicitation penalties (reasonable)
- 12-month non-compete (if properly scoped)
- Standard transfer restrictions (ROFR, tag/co-sale)

### Phase 4: Maintain (Already Favorable)
- Single trigger acceleration
- 2/3 drag-along threshold
