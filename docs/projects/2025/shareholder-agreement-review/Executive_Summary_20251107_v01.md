# Executive Summary: Shareholder Agreement Review
**Date:** November 7, 2025
**Prepared For:** Emil Timmreck Pedersen, CEO
**Prepared By:** Regla Legal Module (AI Legal Expert System)
**Meeting:** Discussion with Martin (External Legal Counsel)
**Document Reviewed:** MW Draft Shareholder Agreement dated August 5, 2025

---

## Overall Assessment: ⚠️ SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS - NOT READY TO SIGN

The draft Shareholder Agreement (SA) prepared by Martin **materially deviates** from the Founders Agreement (FA) in ways that are **predominantly founder-unfavorable**, particularly for you as CEO. Critical terms are undefined, some provisions appear copy-pasted from unrelated templates, and several key FA principles have been omitted or reversed.

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT SIGN** without substantial negotiation and revision.

## Critical Issues Summary

### 🔴 **CRITICAL (Must Resolve Before Signing)**

| # | Issue | Impact | FA Terms | SA Terms |
|---|-------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **Vesting Period Undefined** | Could extend from 2→4 years | 2 years with 1-year cliff | **[BLANK]** with MW note suggesting 48 months |
| 2 | **Vesting Start Date Undefined** | Lose 8+ months credit (Aug 2024-now) | Emil: Aug 15, 2024<br>Anton/Yuri: Apr 1, 2025 | **[BLANK]** - no differentiation |
| 3 | **Bad Leaver = Total Loss** | Lose ALL shares at par value (~DKK 6,668 = €895) even if vested and company worth millions | Not addressed | Company can buy ALL shares at par value if bad leaver |
| 4 | **Hiring Requires Unanimity** | Any co-founder can block ANY hire - operational paralysis | Not restricted | Requires unanimous consent (Clause 6.1(ix)) |
| 5 | **Non-Compete Wrong Industry** | Says "alcohol free wine" instead of medical device compliance | Medical device compliance | **"alcohol free wine"** (Clause 18.1) |
| 6 | **CEO Tiebreaker Removed** | Loss of deadlock-breaking authority | CEO breaks ties unless 2/3 override | No tiebreaker; unanimity required for material decisions |
| 7 | **Dual-Class Shares Omitted** | FA called this "strategic priority" to preserve control | "strategic priority" for founder control | Not mentioned; all shares = 1 vote |
| 8 | **Unanimous Material Decisions** | Any party can veto: debt >50k, expenses >50k, dividends, amendments | Majority vote | Requires ALL parties consent (Clause 6.1) |
| 9 | **Cliff Period Bad Leaver Risk** | If adopted: ANY termination in Year 1 = total loss | Cliff exists but not tied to bad leaver | MW asking if this should apply (highlighted) |

### 🟠 **HIGH PRIORITY (Should Negotiate)**

| # | Issue | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|-------|--------|----------------|
| 10 | **Good Leaver Treatment** | Good leaver loses unvested shares at par value | Negotiate fair market value for at least portion |
| 11 | **Breach Penalty (50% Discount)** | Material breach → forced sale at FMV minus 50% | Negotiate removal or reduce discount to 25% |
| 12 | **No ESOP Mentioned** | FA specified 10% pool - affects dilution | Clarify ESOP in SA or separate document |
| 13 | **Different Vesting Start Dates** | FA recognized your earlier start (Aug 2024 vs Apr 2025 for others) | Demand recognition of differentiated vesting |

### ✅ **POSITIVE TERMS (Better Than FA)**

- **Single Trigger Acceleration:** All shares vest automatically upon Exit (Clause 14.7) - FA left this "to be negotiated"
- **Drag-Along Threshold:** 2/3 threshold maintained (consistent with FA)

---

## Risk Count by Severity

- **Critical (🔴):** 9 issues - must resolve before signing
- **High Priority (🟠):** 4 issues - should negotiate strongly
- **Medium Priority (🟡):** 3 issues - note for discussion
- **Positive (✅):** 2 terms - maintain these

---

## Financial Impact Example

**Scenario:** Company exits at €10M valuation in 3 years

### If You're Terminated as "Bad Leaver" Under SA:
- **Your ownership:** 33.33% = €3.33M in value
- **SA bad leaver provision:** Company buys at par value = DKK 6,668 (€895)
- **Your loss:** €3,329,105 (99.97% loss)

### If Vesting Extended from 2→4 Years:
- **FA:** Fully vested after 2 years
- **SA (if 4 years):** Only 75% vested after 3 years at exit
- **Impact:** 25% of your shares (€833K) could be subject to good/bad leaver provisions

---

## Key Negotiation Priorities (Ranked)

### Must-Have (Non-Negotiable):

1. **Vesting Period:** Maximum 2 years (per FA), not 4 years
2. **Vesting Start Dates:** Emil Aug 15, 2024; Anton/Yuri Apr 1, 2025 (per FA)
3. **Bad Leaver Scope:** Should apply to **unvested shares only**, NOT vested shares
4. **Bad Leaver Price:** Fair market value for vested shares, NOT par value
5. **Fix Non-Compete:** Change to medical device compliance industry
6. **Hiring Authority:** Remove unanimous consent requirement or set threshold (>€100K salary)
7. **CEO Tiebreaker:** Restore FA provision or accept qualified majority (not unanimity)

### Important (High Priority):

8. **Dual-Class Shares:** Include provisions or state intent to implement
9. **Material Decisions:** Reduce unanimity list or change to 2/3 majority
10. **Good Leaver Treatment:** FMV for portion of unvested shares (e.g., time-pro-rated)
11. **ESOP:** Reference 10% pool from FA

### Negotiable (Consider Trade-offs):

12. **Cliff Period Bad Leaver:** Reject automatic bad leaver status within cliff
13. **Breach Penalty:** Negotiate down from 50% to 25% discount
14. **Acceleration:** Maintain single-trigger (already favorable)

## Quality Concern: Copy-Paste Errors

The "alcohol free wine" non-compete clause (SA 18.1) is a **significant red flag**. This appears to be copy-pasted from another client's agreement without proper customization. This raises concerns about:

- **Template Quality:** What else wasn't properly reviewed?
- **Attention to Detail:** Critical for legal documents
- **Other Provisions:** Should carefully verify all clauses aren't from other contexts

**Action:** Explicitly raise this with Martin to ensure full document review.

## What the FA Intended vs. What the SA Provides

| Principle | FA Intent | SA Reality |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Emil's CEO Authority** | Tiebreaker in deadlock | No tiebreaker; unanimous consent required |
| **Founder Control** | Dual-class shares "strategic priority" | Not mentioned; one share = one vote |
| **Vesting Duration** | 2 years | Undefined (likely 4 years per MW note) |
| **Vesting Credit** | Emil started Aug 15, 2024 | Undefined; risk of reset to signing date |
| **Team Rewards** | "Share rewards with everyone involved" | Bad leaver loses everything at par value |
| **Operational Flexibility** | CEO-led with majority decisions | Unanimity required for hiring, expenses >50k |
| **Non-Compete Scope** | Medical device compliance | Alcohol free wine (!!) |

---

## Bottom Line

**The draft SA is not aligned with the FA you and your co-founders agreed to.** It substantially shifts control away from you as CEO, creates extreme downside risks through bad leaver provisions, leaves critical terms undefined, and contains obvious errors suggesting insufficient customization.

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Do NOT sign** this version
2. **Use detailed analysis** (following documents) to prepare specific negotiation points
3. **Raise quality concerns** explicitly with Martin (alcohol wine clause)
4. **Demand alignment** with FA principles, especially:
   - 2-year vesting (not 4)
   - Vesting credit from Aug 2024
   - Bad leaver = unvested shares only
   - CEO operational authority
   - Dual-class shares intent

5. **Consider second opinion** if Martin resists major revisions - these are substantial issues
