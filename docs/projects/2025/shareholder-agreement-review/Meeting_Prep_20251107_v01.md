# Meeting Preparation: Shareholder Agreement Discussion
**Date:** November 7, 2025
**Meeting With:** Martin (External Legal Counsel)
**Your Position:** Emil Timmreck Pedersen, CEO Regla ApS
**Objective:** Negotiate substantial revisions to draft SA to align with Founders Agreement

---

## Meeting Approach Strategy

### Opening Tone: Collaborative but Firm

"Martin, thank you for preparing the draft SA. I've conducted a thorough review comparing it to our Founders Agreement, and I've identified several areas where the draft deviates significantly from what we agreed among the founders. I'd like to walk through these systematically to ensure the final SA reflects our actual agreement and protects our interests appropriately."

**Avoid:**
- Accusatory tone ("You didn't follow instructions")
- Accepting template language without questioning
- Agreeing to "think about it" without specific revision commitment

**Maintain:**
- Professional, collaborative approach
- Firm boundaries on non-negotiable points
- Focus on FA as the source of truth for founder intentions

---

## Key Messages to Convey

1. **"The Founders Agreement is our governing document for what we actually agreed to."**
   - Use this repeatedly to anchor negotiations
   - FA = evidence of actual meeting of minds

2. **"We're pre-investment, so we have flexibility to set founder-favorable terms now."**
   - Unlike investor-led rounds, this is founder-to-founder agreement
   - We control the terms; should reflect our interests

3. **"Some of these provisions would make the company unoperational or unattractive to investors."**
   - Unanimous hiring consent = operational paralysis
   - Extreme bad leaver provisions = founder flight risk

4. **"I need you to confirm the entire document has been properly reviewed and customized."**
   - Alcohol wine clause raises quality concerns
   - Need assurance other provisions aren't copy-paste errors

---

## Critical Issues - Non-Negotiable (MUST FIX)

### Issue #1: Vesting Period

**Problem:** Blank in SA; MW note suggests 48 months
**FA Terms:** 2 years with 1-year cliff (page 2, Section 2.2)

**Your Position:**
"The FA explicitly states two-year vesting. This was a deliberate decision we made as founders to have shorter vesting than market standard. I need the SA to reflect 24 months, not 48 months."

**Martin May Say:** "48 months is market standard for investors."

**Your Response:**
"We're not at the investor stage yet. This is a founder agreement. When investors come in, we can discuss whether their shares have different vesting terms, but our founder shares vest over 2 years as we agreed. That's not negotiable."

**Talking Point:**
- FA Section 2.2 page 2: "two-year period with a one-year cliff"
- We consciously chose shorter vesting
- This is binding between us as founders

**Red Line:** Will not accept more than 24 months for founder shares

---

### Issue #2: Vesting Start Dates

**Problem:** Single start date (blank) in SA
**FA Terms:** Emil (Aug 15, 2024), Anton/Yuri (Apr 1, 2025)

**Your Position:**
"The FA recognizes that I started working full-time in August 2024, while Anton and Yuri start in April 2025. I've now been working for 15 months. The SA must reflect these different start dates, or I lose all that vesting credit."

**Martin May Say:** "It's cleaner to have everyone start from the same date."

**Your Response:**
"That might be administratively simpler, but it's economically unjust. I've been working unpaid or underpaid for 15 months building this company. Those contributions deserve vesting credit. The FA explicitly states these dates, and they must be preserved."

**Calculation to Share:**
- 15 months at 24-month vesting = 62.5% of my shares should already be vested
- That's worth over €2M at a €10M valuation
- I'm not forfeiting that because of an administrative preference

**Red Line:** Will not accept reset of vesting start date for Emil's shares

---

### Issue #3: Bad Leaver Applies to ALL Shares

**Problem:** Clause 14.4 allows Company to buy ALL shares (vested + unvested) at par value if bad leaver
**FA Terms:** Not addressed (no bad leaver provision)

**Your Position:**
"The bad leaver provision as written would allow the company to take back shares I've already earned - potentially millions of euros worth - for just 900 euros. That's not acceptable. Bad leaver provisions should apply only to unvested shares."

**Martin May Say:** "This is standard investor protection."

**Your Response:**
"We don't have investors yet - this is a founder agreement. And even in investor-led deals, bad leaver typically applies to unvested shares only. Vested shares represent work already completed and contributions already made. Taking those at par value is punitive and unjust. I need bad leaver to apply only to unvested shares, with vested shares either retained by the founder or purchased at fair market value."

**Counter-Proposal:**
- **Bad Leaver:** Unvested shares purchased at par value
- **Vested Shares:** Founder retains OR Company can purchase at fair market value (not par)

**Red Line:** Will not accept bad leaver provision applying to vested shares

---

### Issue #4: Hiring Requires Unanimity

**Problem:** Clause 6.1(ix) requires ALL parties consent for "hiring of new employees"
**FA Terms:** CEO responsible for operations; not restricted

**Your Position:**
"Requiring unanimous consent to hire anyone - including junior developers or interns - would paralyze the company. As CEO, I need operational authority to build the team. Any co-founder could block any hire for any reason, creating impossible delays."

**Martin May Say:** "This protects all founders from hiring decisions they disagree with."

**Your Response:**
"Protection is good, but this goes too far. We should have a threshold - unanimous consent for C-level positions or salaries above 100K euros, but qualified majority or CEO authority for other hires. Otherwise we can't move fast enough to compete."

**Examples to Use:**
- "What if we need to hire a developer quickly to meet a customer deadline, and one founder is traveling and unavailable?"
- "What if two founders think we need a salesperson but one disagrees - should that block the hire entirely?"

**Counter-Proposal:**
Unanimous consent required ONLY for:
- Executive Management positions
- Salaries >€100,000/year
- Equity grants >2%

All other hiring: Qualified majority (2 of 3) or CEO authority within approved budget

**Red Line:** Will not accept unanimity for all hiring

---

### Issue #5: Non-Compete Wrong Industry

**Problem:** Clause 18.1 says "alcohol free wine" instead of medical device compliance

**Your Position:**
"Martin, the non-compete clause says 'alcohol free wine.' Our business is medical device compliance documentation. This appears to be copy-pasted from another client's agreement. I need you to confirm that the entire document has been properly reviewed and customized for our situation, because this error raises concerns about other provisions."

**Martin May Say:** "That's just a typo, we can fix it."

**Your Response:**
"I appreciate that, and I need it fixed. But it's not just a typo - it's the core definition of what we do as a business. It suggests the document may not have been thoroughly reviewed. Before we proceed, I need your confirmation that every provision has been checked for our specific situation and not just carried over from a template."

**Correct Language Needed:**
"... medical device regulatory compliance, clinical evaluation documentation, or software-as-a-medical-device compliance automation"

**Follow-Up Question:**
"Are there other provisions in this SA that were carried over from other agreements without customization?"

**Red Line:** Will not sign until confident entire document is properly customized

---

### Issue #6: CEO Tiebreaker Removed

**Problem:** SA requires unanimity for material decisions; no tiebreaker mechanism
**FA Terms:** Section 5.1 - CEO breaks deadlock unless 2/3 override

**Your Position:**
"The FA gives me tiebreaker authority as CEO, overridable by two-thirds. The SA eliminates that and requires unanimity, which creates deadlock risk. For a startup to operate effectively, there needs to be a decision mechanism when we disagree."

**Martin May Say:** "Unanimity ensures all founders are aligned on important decisions."

**Your Response:**
"Alignment is good, but deadlock is fatal. What happens if we genuinely disagree on an important decision and can't reach unanimity? The company is paralyzed. The FA had a balanced solution - CEO breaks ties, but a supermajority can override the CEO. That protects against both deadlock and CEO unilateralism. We need that mechanism in the SA."

**Counter-Proposal:**
Restore FA provision:
- Qualified majority (2 of 3) for material decisions
- If deadlock (1-1-1), CEO decides
- BUT 2 of 3 can override CEO if needed

**Alternative:**
- Reduce unanimity list to truly extraordinary matters (sale of company, IPO, liquidation)
- All other material decisions: Qualified majority

**Red Line:** Will not accept pure unanimity with no tiebreaker mechanism

---

### Issue #7: Dual-Class Shares Omitted

**Problem:** SA doesn't mention dual-class shares
**FA Terms:** Section 11 - "strategic priority" for founder enhanced voting rights

**Your Position:**
"The FA explicitly states that dual-class shares with enhanced founder voting rights are a 'strategic priority.' This was important to us for maintaining control as we bring in investors. Why isn't this in the SA?"

**Martin May Say:** "Dual-class is typically implemented at the first funding round."

**Your Response:**
"I understand that's when it's usually implemented operationally, but we should state our intent in the SA now. At minimum, the SA should include a provision saying we intend to implement dual-class structure before or concurrent with institutional investment. Otherwise, we lose negotiating leverage with investors."

**Proposed Addition:**
"The Parties intend to implement a dual-class share structure with enhanced voting rights for Founder Shares prior to or concurrent with the first institutional investment round, subject to legal and regulatory requirements."

**Alternative:**
Include provision allowing conversion to dual-class with qualified majority vote

**Red Line:** At minimum, must state intent to implement dual-class

---

### Issue #8: Material Decisions Unanimity List Too Broad

**Problem:** Clause 6.1 requires unanimous consent for extensive list including debt >50k DKK (~€6,700), expenses >50k DKK, hiring, litigation

**Your Position:**
"The unanimous consent list is so broad that it covers routine operational decisions. The €6,700 threshold for debt and expenses is very low - many normal business activities exceed that. We need to either raise these thresholds or move many items to qualified majority."

**Specific Examples:**
- "Hiring a senior developer at €60K salary requires unanimity"
- "A €10K marketing campaign requires unanimity"
- "This SA legal review probably cost more than €6,700 - under these terms, we couldn't have hired you without unanimous consent"

**Counter-Proposal:**
**Tier 1 - Unanimous:**
- Sale of company
- IPO
- Liquidation
- Amendments to articles
- Dividends

**Tier 2 - Qualified Majority (2 of 3):**
- Debt >€100,000
- Expenses >€50,000 (unless in approved budget)
- Asset sales
- Litigation >€50,000
- Guarantees >€100,000

**Tier 3 - CEO Authority:**
- Operational decisions within approved budget
- Hiring (except Executive Management or >€100K)
- Expenses <€50,000

**Red Line:** Will not accept €6,700 thresholds with unanimity requirement

---

### Issue #9: Cliff Period Bad Leaver

**Problem:** Highlighted option in clause 1.1 would make ANY termination in first 12 months a bad leaver event
**Your Position:** "If we include this provision, a founder terminated by the company without cause - even due to the company's own breach - would lose everything at par value. That's unconscionable. This provision should not be included."

**Red Line:** Will not accept automatic bad leaver status for cliff period termination regardless of fault

---

## High Priority Issues - Negotiate Strongly

### Issue #10: Good Leaver Par Value for Unvested

**Problem:** Good leaver loses unvested shares at par value
**Your Position:** "Even though we're not bad leavers - company terminates us without cause - we get almost nothing for unvested shares. I'd like to negotiate some economic value for time contributed."

**Counter-Proposal:**
- Time-prorated fair market value for unvested shares, OR
- Minimum value floor (greater of par value, book value, or 25% FMV)

**Fallback:** Accept par value IF other critical issues resolved

---

### Issue #11: Breach Penalty 50% Discount

**Problem:** Material breach = forced sale at FMV minus 50%
**Your Position:** "50% discount is very punitive, especially for breaches that might be minor or disputed. I'd like to either eliminate the discount or reduce it to 25%."

**Counter-Proposal:**
- No discount (FMV + damages), OR
- Maximum 25% discount, OR
- Tiered based on severity

**Fallback:** Accept 50% IF critical issues resolved and breach definition is tightened

---

### Issue #12: ESOP Not Mentioned

**Problem:** No mention of 10% ESOP from FA
**Your Position:** "The FA specifies a 10% ESOP pool. Should we include that in the SA to clarify dilution expectations?"

**Proposed Addition:**
"The Parties agree that the Company shall establish an Employee Stock Option Plan reserving 10% of fully diluted shares for employees and advisors."

**Fallback:** Can be addressed in separate ESOP document, but clarify that it's not additional dilution beyond what FA contemplated

---

### Issue #13: No Differentiated Start Dates

**Problem:** Single vesting start date doesn't reflect Emil's earlier start
**(Covered under Issue #2 above)**

---

## Questions to Ask Martin

### Quality Assurance Questions

1. **"Can you walk me through your process for customizing this SA template for Regla?"**
   - Listen for: Did he start from scratch, use template, review FA line-by-line?

2. **"Besides the alcohol wine clause, are there other provisions that weren't updated from the template?"**
   - Get explicit confirmation of template vs. customized provisions

3. **"Have you encountered situations where clients signed SAs that created operational problems later?"**
   - Test whether he understands startup operational realities

### Strategic Questions

4. **"When investors come in, will these terms create problems?"**
   - Specifically: Unanimous hiring consent, extreme bad leaver provisions
   - Good investors will see these as red flags for founder flight risk

5. **"How do these terms compare to other founder agreements you've drafted for pre-investment Danish startups?"**
   - Gauge whether this is unusually investor-favorable for a pure founder agreement

6. **"What's your experience with dual-class share structures in Denmark?"**
   - Understand his capability to implement this later

### Technical Questions

7. **"If we have a deadlock under the unanimous consent provisions, what's the resolution mechanism?"**
   - Force him to confront the paralysis risk

8. **"How would you defend the bad leaver provision applying to vested shares if challenged in Danish court?"**
   - Test legal reasoning for this unusual provision

9. **"What happens if we sign this and then realize a provision isn't workable - how expensive is it to amend?"**
   - Understand cost of fixing problems later

### Process Questions

10. **"Can you prepare a revised draft addressing these issues by [specific date]?"**
    - Set timeline expectations

11. **"Would you be comfortable if I had another lawyer review the revised draft before we sign?"**
    - Gauge his confidence in his work; assert your right to second opinion

12. **"What's your fee arrangement for revisions?"**
    - Understand if extensive revisions will cost significant additional fees

## Negotiation Strategy

### Prioritized Negotiation Approach

**Phase 1: Address Copy-Paste Error First**
- Start with alcohol wine clause
- Establishes that document needs careful review
- Sets tone that you're paying attention to details

**Phase 2: Tackle Critical Terms**
- Present as package: "These are the must-fix issues from the FA"
- Use FA as source of truth throughout
- Be firm: "These aren't negotiable because we already agreed to them"

**Phase 3: High-Priority Items**
- Frame as: "I'd also like to discuss these terms that concern me"
- Be willing to prioritize some over others
- Show flexibility here IF critical terms are fixed

**Phase 4: Close and Timeline**
- "Can you prepare a revised draft incorporating these changes by [date]?"
- "I'd like to review the revised version before we schedule signing"
- "Let's plan a follow-up call to discuss any remaining issues"

### Leverage Points

**Your Leverage:**
- You're the client and paying for the SA
- You can seek second opinion from another lawyer
- You can delay signing if not comfortable
- You control the founder discussion (Martin works for you, not vice versa)

**Martin's Leverage:**
- You need an SA to proceed with fundraising
- You've already invested time/money in this process
- Extensive revisions may incur additional fees
- Other founders may have different views

**Leverage Strategy:**
- Emphasize you're committed to getting this right, not rushing
- Frame requests as "alignment with FA" not "changing negotiated terms"
- Show willingness to pay for thorough work, but also willingness to seek alternatives

### If Martin Resists

**If he says "This is standard":**
- "Standard for investor-led deals, but this is founder-to-founder. What's standard for pre-investment founder agreements?"

**If he says "The founders need to negotiate among themselves first":**
- "We already did - that's the Founders Agreement. Your job is to reflect that agreement in legally binding form, not to change the negotiated terms."

**If he says "This will create problems with future investors":**
- "Let's address that when investors arrive. Right now, this is a founder agreement, and it should protect founders."

**If he says "These changes will take significant time/cost":**
- "I understand, but getting it right is worth the investment. Can you provide a revised fee estimate?"
- Alternative: "If this is beyond your capacity, I can engage another firm to review or revise."

**If he gets defensive about the alcohol wine error:**
- Stay calm: "I'm not attacking your competence. I'm just doing my due diligence as CEO to ensure we're signing the right document. That's my fiduciary duty to the company and co-founders."

### Red Lines - When to Walk Away from Martin

**Immediate Red Flags:**
1. Refuses to fix alcohol wine clause or gets defensive about quality concerns
2. Says "just sign this and we'll fix it later" for critical terms
3. Insists on 48-month vesting without strong justification
4. Won't recognize Emil's vesting start date credit
5. Dismisses concerns as "not understanding legal documents"

**If Multiple Red Flags:**
- "Martin, I appreciate your work, but I'm not comfortable proceeding without addressing these issues. Let me get a second opinion on the draft, and we can reconvene after that."

**Alternative Lawyers:**
- Research Danish startup law firms
- Get recommendations from startup accelerators or other founders
- Budget €5,000-€10,000 for second opinion or redraft

## Confidence Boosters

**Remember:**

2. **You're not a legal expert, but you're a smart business person** - your concerns are valid

4. **You have leverage** - you're the client, you can seek other counsel, you can delay signing

**If you feel pressured:**
- "I need time to think about this. Let's schedule a follow-up call."
- "I'd like to discuss this with my co-founders before deciding."
- "Let me review the revised draft before we proceed further."

**Trust your instincts:**
- If something feels wrong, it probably is
