# PART I: FOUNDATION

## Strategic Framework

### Mission
Structure Regla ApS's Shareholder Agreement to optimize across three dimensions:
- **Founder Protection** (control, economics, flexibility)
- **Investor Attraction** (professional, market-standard, clear rights)
- **Scalability** (evolves through funding rounds)

### Methodology
This analysis uses systematic AI-powered legal analysis leveraging:
- **Complete coverage**: 100% examination of all provisions (no sampling)
- **Parallel scenario modeling**: Simultaneous evaluation of multiple outcomes
- **Evidence-based benchmarking**: Nordic market data from byFounders, Nordic Makers
- **Interaction analysis**: Cross-term effects explicitly modeled
- **8-step systematic process**: Applied to each major provision category

### Success Criteria
Emil can articulate strategy, make informed decisions, negotiate confidently, position for investment, and understand trade-offs.

## Guiding Principles

These 7 axiomatic principles guide every recommendation:

### 1. Founder Alignment Principle
**Statement:** "All founders' incentives must align for long-term value creation"

**Rationale:** 3 founders (Emil, Anton, Yuri) with staggered starts need equal treatment going forward to prevent conflicts and ensure unified commitment.

**Implications:**
- Same vesting terms for all founders (from their respective start dates)
- Balanced governance (no founder has absolute control over others)
- No special privileges that create resentment
- IP assignment applies equally to all

**Application Example:** Emil's earlier start recognized through initial equity split or partial immediate vesting, but forward-looking vesting is identical for all.

---

### 2. Investor Readiness Principle
**Statement:** "SA must not require substantial renegotiation in Series A"

**Rationale:** Unusual or non-standard terms in founder SA create friction in first institutional round. Investors expect to see market-standard structures.

**Implications:**
- Use Nordic market standards (1x non-participating, 75% drag-along, BWA anti-dilution)
- Avoid experimental structures (e.g., complex voting mechanisms)
- Include provisions that anticipate investor participation
- Structure for professional presentation

**Application Example:** Including ESOP reservation signals planning sophistication; dual-class share provision shows forward thinking.

---

### 3. Operational Autonomy Principle
**Statement:** "CEO must control day-to-day decisions without board/shareholder approval"

**Rationale:** Martin's draft demonstrated operational paralysis from unanimous consent requirements. Emil needs authority to run company effectively.

**Implications:**
- High thresholds for approval requirements (>€50K contracts, not >€6.7K)
- Limited reserved matters (major decisions only, not routine operations)
- CEO authority for hiring employees below VP level
- Board approval for strategic, not tactical, decisions

**Application Example:** CEO can hire junior developer (€60K salary) without approval, but needs board consent for CTO (€120K+ salary).

---

### 4. Control Preservation Principle
**Statement:** "Founders collectively maintain >50% voting control through Series A"

**Rationale:** Control enables long-term value building without interference. Losing control too early leads to short-term pressures and potential founder/investor conflicts.

**Implications:**
- Board structure: founders control board until Series A
- Drag-along threshold: ≥75% prevents investor-only decision
- Dual-class shares: 10:1 voting preserves control post-Series A
- Reserved matters: balanced, not investor veto on everything

**Application Example:** At Series A (20% investor ownership), founders retain 80% voting through ordinary shares + 10:1 super-voting shares.

---

### 5. Fair Exit Principle
**Statement:** "Pro-rata treatment in exits with reasonable investor preference"

**Rationale:** Align incentives. Avoid structures where one party captures most value at extreme expense of other.

**Implications:**
- 1x non-participating liquidation preference (not participating)
- Bad leaver applies to unvested only (not vested shares at par)
- Good leaver receives FMV for time-vested portion
- Drag-along terms apply equally (same price, same terms for all)

**Application Example:** At €10M exit with 1x non-participating, investor gets €2M (20%), founders get €8M (80%). With participating, founders get only €6.4M (20% reduction).

---

### 6. Dispute Efficiency Principle
**Statement:** "Deadlocks must resolve through clear mechanisms within 90 days"

**Rationale:** Founder disputes can paralyze company. Need clear, fast resolution mechanisms.

**Implications:**
- CEO tiebreaker for operational deadlocks (overridable by 2/3)
- Mediation → Arbitration process (30 days → 60 days)
- Clear good/bad leaver definitions (objective criteria)
- Buyout procedures with specified valuation methodology

**Application Example:** If founders split 2-1 on hiring VP of Sales, CEO breaks tie. If founders disagree on CEO's decision, 2 of 3 can override.

---

### 7. Evolution Design Principle
**Statement:** "SA specifies how it adapts through funding rounds"

**Rationale:** Avoid future conflicts by planning evolution in advance. Investors appreciate clarity on how their participation will work.

**Implications:**
- Board scaling roadmap (3 → 5 at Series A → 7 at Series B)
- Amendment procedures clearly defined
- Investor rights framework (what new investors get)
- Option pool expansion triggers and methodology

**Application Example:** SA states "Upon Series A investment of ≥€2M, board expands to 5 members: 2 founder directors, 2 investor directors, 1 independent."

## Regla Context Analysis

### Company Profile
- **Entity:** Regla ApS (Danish private limited company)
- **Stage:** Pre-investment, founder-owned
- **Industry:** Medical device compliance software (RegTech/MedTech)
- **Business Model:** B2B SaaS (Clinical Evaluation Plans/Reports for EU MDR)
- **Technology:** Claude Code AI agents with specialized regulatory knowledge

### Stakeholder Objectives

#### Emil (Founder/CEO, Early Start: Aug 15, 2024)
**Primary Objectives:**
- Maintain operational control through Series A
- Receive recognition for early work (pre-Anton/Yuri start)
- Protect against unfair bad leaver treatment
- Build long-term value without short-term investor pressure

**Key Concerns:**
- Losing CEO authority to unanimous consent requirements
- Vesting extension without credit for time already invested
- Extreme downside if terminated (all shares at par value)

**Optimal Outcomes:**
- 25% of allocation vests immediately (recognizes Aug 2024-Apr 2025 work)
- CEO tiebreaker for operational decisions
- Bad leaver applies to unvested only
- Founder-controlled board through Series A

#### Anton/Yuri (Technical Co-Founders, Start: Apr 1, 2025)
**Primary Objectives:**
- Fair equity treatment despite later start
- Meaningful governance participation (not Emil-dominated)
- Protection against Emil marginalizing technical founders

**Key Concerns:**
- Emil could leverage early start for excessive equity or control
- Decisions made without technical founder input
- "Second-class" treatment vs CEO

**Optimal Outcomes:**
- Same vesting schedule as Emil (from April 1 start)
- Board representation or clear governance voice
- Material decisions require more than CEO alone

#### Future Investors (Hypothetical Series A)
**Primary Objectives:**
- Downside protection (get investment back in poor exits)
- Board representation (1-2 seats at Series A)
- Veto rights on major decisions (sale, capital changes, material contracts)
- Information rights (monthly financials, metrics)

**Key Concerns:**
- Founder vesting insufficient (founders could leave without penalty)
- Lack of control over major decisions
- Misaligned incentives (founders prioritize control over exits)

**Optimal Outcomes:**
- 4-year founder vesting (demonstrates commitment)
- 1-2 board seats at Series A
- Reserved matters list (veto on sale, capital changes, senior hires, material contracts)
- 1x liquidation preference (downside protection)

### Constraint Analysis

#### Hard Constraints (Cannot Violate)
1. **Danish ApS Law Requirements:**
   - Minimum capital DKK 40,000
   - Articles of association required
   - Shareholder register maintained
   - Annual filings with Erhvervsstyrelsen

2. **Nordic Market Standards:**
   - Cannot deviate too far from market norms or scare investors
   - 4-year vesting is universal
   - 1x liquidation preference is Nordic standard
   - Board representation at Series A expected

3. **Operational Feasibility:**
   - Cannot require unanimous consent for routine decisions (paralysis)
   - CEO needs day-to-day authority
   - Decision thresholds must be reasonable

#### Soft Constraints (Preferences, Not Requirements)
1. **Founder Preferences:**
   - Minimize control dilution
   - Maximize economic upside
   - Maintain flexibility

2. **Investor Expectations:**
   - Prefer less founder protection
   - Want meaningful control rights
   - Expect standard terms

3. **Co-Founder Dynamics:**
   - Balance Emil's CEO role with co-founder participation
   - Recognize differential start dates fairly
   - Prevent any single founder from dominating

### Lessons from Martin's Draft SA

**Key Findings from Systematic Review (18 material issues identified):**

**Critical Errors:**
1. Vesting period undefined (blank with MW note suggesting 48 months vs FA's 24 months)
2. Vesting start dates undefined (Emil loses 8+ months credit)
3. Bad leaver = total loss (all shares at par value, even vested)
4. Hiring requires unanimity (operational paralysis)
5. Non-compete wrong industry ("alcohol free wine" instead of medical device)
6. CEO tiebreaker removed (no deadlock mechanism)
7. Dual-class shares omitted (FA called this "strategic priority")
8. Unanimous consent for material decisions (extensive list with low thresholds)

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Explicit is essential:** No blank fields, no undefined terms
- **Founder protection matters:** Bad leaver must be scoped appropriately
- **Operational feasibility critical:** Thresholds must allow CEO to operate
- **Quality control necessary:** Copy-paste errors indicate insufficient review

**Application to Recommendations:**
Every recommendation in this document addresses lessons learned from Martin's draft. We will NOT repeat those mistakes.

# PART II: SIX SCOPE AREAS - DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS

---

# 1. FOUNDER PROTECTION & CONTROL

## Overview
This scope area addresses how to protect founders' interests while signaling commitment to investors. Key tensions: control vs capital, protection vs flexibility.

---

## 1.1 Founder Vesting Structure

### Decision Points
1. Should founders have vesting? (Yes—investor requirement)
2. What vesting schedule? (Duration, cliff, frequency)
3. When does vesting start? (Differentiated vs uniform)
4. What acceleration provisions? (Single vs double trigger)
5. What happens to Emil's early work? (Immediate vesting portion)

### Option Analysis

#### Option A: No Founder Vesting (Immediate 100%)
**Structure:** All founder shares vest immediately upon issuance.

**Pros:**
- Founders fully own equity from day one
- No risk of losing shares if terminated
- Maximum founder protection

**Cons:**
- Major investor red flag (no commitment signal)
- Co-founder risk (founder leaves early with full equity)
- Will require renegotiation at Series A (investor will demand vesting)

**Market Context:** Extremely rare. >99% of VC-backed startups have founder vesting.

**Recommendation:** ❌ REJECT (creates future friction, fails Investor Readiness Principle)

---

#### Option B: Standard 4-Year with 1-Year Cliff (Market Standard)
**Structure:**
- 4-year total vesting period
- 1-year cliff (0% vests until month 12, then 25% vests)
- Monthly vesting thereafter (1/48th per month for months 13-48)

**Example:**
- 1,000,000 shares granted
- Month 1-11: 0 shares vested
- Month 12: 250,000 shares vest (cliff releases 12 months at once)
- Month 13: 270,833 shares vested (cliff + month 13)
- Month 14-48: +20,833 shares per month
- Month 48: 1,000,000 shares fully vested

**Pros:**
- Universal investor expectation
- Demonstrates founder commitment (4-year horizon)
- Cliff protects company from very early departures
- Monthly vesting provides gradual ownership
- Aligns incentives (stay = earn equity)

**Cons:**
- Founders could lose unvested shares if terminated
- Cliff creates "cliff vesting risk" in year 1

**Market Context:** This is THE standard. byFounders data: >95% of Nordic startups use 4-year with 1-year cliff.

**Recommendation:** ✅ ADOPT as baseline (Investor Readiness Principle)

---

#### Option C: Shorter Period (3-Year with 6-Month Cliff)
**Structure:** Faster vesting, shorter cliff

**Pros:**
- Founders fully vested sooner (lower risk)
- Shorter cliff reduces year-1 risk

**Cons:**
- Unusual (investors may question commitment)
- Doesn't align with market standard

**Market Context:** Rare, seen only with serial entrepreneurs with strong track records.

**Recommendation:** ❌ AVOID (violates Investor Readiness Principle unless Emil has exceptional leverage)

---

#### Option D: Acceleration Provisions (Critical Addition)

**No Acceleration (Baseline):**
- Acquisition happens → Vesting continues on original schedule
- Founder terminated post-acquisition → Loses unvested shares
- Risk: Acquirer buys company, terminates founder, founder walks away with only vested portion

**Single-Trigger Acceleration:**
- Trigger: Acquisition event alone causes acceleration
- Effect: 50-100% of unvested shares vest immediately upon acquisition
- Pros: Maximum founder protection
- Cons: Acquirer resistance (inherits fully-vested founders who could leave), reduces retention incentive
- Market: Rare, difficult to negotiate

**Double-Trigger Acceleration (RECOMMENDED):**
- Triggers: (1) Acquisition AND (2) Termination without cause within 12-24 months
- Effect: If both triggers occur, X% of unvested shares accelerate
- Percentage options:
  - 50% acceleration: Conservative
  - 75% acceleration: Common
  - 100% acceleration: Founder-favorable

**Example Scenario: 100% Double-Trigger Acceleration**
- Founder has 1M shares, 50% vested (500K) at time of acquisition
- Post-acquisition, founder terminated without cause
- Double-trigger: Remaining 500K unvested shares accelerate immediately
- Founder leaves with 1M shares (full protection)

**Without Acceleration:**
- Same scenario, founder leaves with only 500K vested shares
- Loses 500K unvested shares (€5M loss at €10/share)

**Recommendation:** ✅ ADOPT 75-100% double-trigger acceleration (Fair Exit Principle)

---

### Regla-Specific Application: Differentiated Vesting Start Dates

**Challenge:** Emil started Aug 15, 2024; Anton/Yuri starting Apr 1, 2025 (8-month gap)

**Approach Options:**

**Option 1: Uniform Start Date (All Vest from SA Signing)**
- All founders begin 4-year vesting from SA execution date
- Ignores Emil's early contribution
- Creates resentment (Emil loses 8 months credit)

**Option 2: Differentiated Start Dates + Immediate Vesting**
- Emil: 25% vests immediately (recognizes Aug 2024-Apr 2025 work), 75% vests over 4 years from Apr 2025
- Anton/Yuri: 0% immediate, 100% vests over 4 years from Apr 2025
- All three vest on same schedule going forward (Apr 2025 → Apr 2029)

**Option 3: Fully Differentiated Start Dates**
- Emil: Vesting starts Aug 2024 → Aug 2028
- Anton/Yuri: Vesting starts Apr 2025 → Apr 2029
- Emil fully vested 8 months earlier than co-founders

**Analysis:**

**Option 2 is OPTIMAL (Founder Alignment Principle):**
- Recognizes Emil's early work through immediate vesting (fair)
- Aligns forward incentives (all vest on same schedule from Apr 2025)
- Signals to investors that all founders committed for same period going forward
- Prevents resentment from later-starting founders
- Example: Emil gets 1,000,000 shares (250K immediate, 750K vest Apr 2025-Apr 2029)

**Recommendation:** ✅ ADOPT Option 2 (balanced recognition + alignment)

**RECOMMENDED CLAUSE:**

```markdown
**Section X: Founder Vesting**

X.1 Vesting Schedule

(a) Each Founder's Shares shall vest over a four (4) year period commencing on such Founder's Vesting Start Date (as defined below), subject to such Founder's Continuous Service (as defined in Section X.5).

(b) Vesting Start Dates:
    (i) Emil Timmreck Pedersen: April 1, 2025
    (ii) [Anton Name]: April 1, 2025
    (iii) [Yuri Name]: April 1, 2025

(c) Subject to Section X.1(d), each Founder's Shares shall vest as follows:
    (i) Cliff: Zero (0) Shares shall vest prior to the one (1) year anniversary of the Vesting Start Date.
    (ii) Cliff Release: On the one (1) year anniversary of the Vesting Start Date, twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares shall vest, provided the Founder remains in Continuous Service.
    (iii) Monthly Vesting: Following the cliff release, the remaining seventy-five percent (75%) of the Shares shall vest in equal monthly installments over the subsequent thirty-six (36) months, provided the Founder remains in Continuous Service.

(d) Notwithstanding Section X.1(c), with respect to Emil Timmreck Pedersen only, twenty-five percent (25%) of his Shares shall vest immediately upon the Effective Date of this Agreement, in recognition of services performed prior to the Vesting Start Date. The remaining seventy-five percent (75%) of Emil Timmreck Pedersen's Shares shall vest in accordance with Section X.1(c).

X.2 Acceleration Upon Change of Control

(a) Double-Trigger Acceleration: If, within twelve (12) months following a Change of Control (as defined in Section X.6), a Founder's Continuous Service is terminated by the Company or successor entity without Cause (as defined in Section X.7), or by the Founder for Good Reason (as defined in Section X.8), then one hundred percent (100%) of such Founder's unvested Shares shall immediately vest and become non-forfeitable.

(b) No Single-Trigger: Except as provided in Section X.2(a), a Change of Control event alone shall not cause acceleration of vesting.

X.3 Treatment Upon Termination

(a) Vested Shares: All Shares that have vested as of the termination date shall remain the property of the Founder.

(b) Unvested Shares: All Shares that have not vested as of the termination date (excluding any accelerated pursuant to Section X.2) shall be subject to the Good Leaver and Bad Leaver provisions in Sections X.9 and X.10.

[Continue with definitions of Continuous Service, Change of Control, Cause, Good Reason, Good Leaver, Bad Leaver...]
```

### Scenario Modeling

**Scenario 1: Standard Exit (No Termination)**
- Emil's 1M shares: 250K immediate + 750K vesting over 4 years
- At 2 years post-April 2025: 625K vested (250K + 375K from vesting)
- At acquisition (month 30), all unvested shares continue vesting
- Founder participates fully in exit based on vested %

**Scenario 2: Post-Acquisition Termination (100% Double-Trigger)**
- Acquisition at month 24: Emil has 625K vested
- Emil terminated without cause within 12 months of acquisition
- Double-trigger accelerates remaining 375K shares
- Emil walks away with 1M shares (100% protected)

**Scenario 3: Voluntary Departure (Good Leaver)**
- Emil leaves voluntarily at month 30 (2.5 years)
- Vested: 656K shares (250K immediate + 406K from 30 months vesting)
- Unvested: 344K shares → subject to Good Leaver provisions (see Risk Management section)

**Scenario 4: Termination for Cause (Bad Leaver)**
- Emil terminated for material breach at month 18
- Vested: 531K shares (250K immediate + 281K from 18 months vesting)
- Unvested: 469K shares → subject to Bad Leaver provisions (company can buyback at par or reduced value)

---

### Negotiation Strategy

**Opening Position:**
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (market standard, non-negotiable)
- 25% immediate vesting for Emil (recognition of early work)
- 100% double-trigger acceleration (strong founder protection)
- Differentiated start dates (all founders from April 2025)

**Fallback Position:**
- Accept 75% double-trigger acceleration (if 100% meets resistance)
- Accept 10-20% immediate vesting for Emil (if 25% considered excessive)
- Consider 18-month post-acquisition window for double-trigger (vs 12 months)

**Red Lines (Will Not Accept):**
- No acceleration whatsoever (too risky for founders)
- Single-trigger acceleration only (acquirers reject this)
- Uniform start date ignoring Emil's early work (unfair)
- Vesting shorter than 4 years (investor red flag)

**Talking Points:**
1. "4-year vesting demonstrates our long-term commitment and is universal in VC-backed companies"
2. "100% double-trigger acceleration protects us from post-acquisition termination while maintaining retention incentive"
3. "25% immediate vesting for Emil recognizes 8 months of work prior to co-founder start, not a gift"
4. "All founders vest on the same forward schedule, ensuring equal future alignment"

**Anticipated Objections & Responses:**

*Objection 1:* "100% acceleration is too founder-friendly; acquirers won't like it"
*Response:* "Double-trigger requires BOTH acquisition AND termination, so acquirers retain control. If they keep us, acceleration doesn't trigger. It only protects us if we're terminated without cause, which is fair."

*Objection 2:* "25% immediate vesting for Emil undermines vesting purpose"
*Response:* "Emil worked 8 months before Anton and Yuri joined, building initial product and customer pipeline. 25% recognizes that contribution while 75% remains subject to full 4-year vesting, demonstrating continued commitment."

*Objection 3:* "Differentiated start dates make cap table messy"
*Response:* "Actually, using April 2025 as the vesting start for all three makes it cleaner—all founders vest on the same schedule going forward. Emil's immediate vesting is a one-time adjustment, not ongoing complexity."

---

### Validation Against Principles

✅ **Founder Alignment:** All founders vest on same schedule (April 2025 start); Emil's immediate vesting recognizes early work fairly
✅ **Investor Readiness:** 4-year with 1-year cliff is universal standard; signals commitment
✅ **Operational Autonomy:** Not directly applicable
✅ **Control Preservation:** Vesting protects founder equity; acceleration prevents loss of control through termination
✅ **Fair Exit:** Double-trigger ensures founders participate in acquisition value even if terminated
✅ **Dispute Efficiency:** Clear vesting definitions reduce disputes
✅ **Evolution Design:** Structure works through all funding rounds without modification

**Result: VALIDATED - Recommendation aligns with all applicable principles**

## 1.2 Board Composition & Evolution

### Decision Points
1. Pre-investment board size and composition
2. Post-Series A board structure
3. How board scales through funding rounds
4. Board election mechanisms
5. Observer rights (if any)

### Option Analysis

#### Pre-Investment Board Structure

**Option A: All 3 Founders on Board**
- Emil, Anton, Yuri all have board seats
- 3-person founder-only board

**Pros:**
- All founders have governance voice
- No external involvement

**Cons:**
- Can become contentious if founders disagree
- No outside perspective
- Investors may want to add seats at Series A, creating 6-person board (too large)

**Option B: 2 Founders + 1 Independent (RECOMMENDED)**
- Emil + 1 co-founder (or Emil + rotating co-founder seat)
- 1 independent director (industry expert, advisor, non-investor)

**Pros:**
- Outside perspective without investor control
- Smaller, more efficient board
- Scales naturally to 5 at Series A (add 2 investor directors)
- Demonstrates sophistication

**Cons:**
- One co-founder may feel excluded
- Need to find qualified independent director

**Option C: CEO Only (2-Person Board)**
- Emil + 1 independent director
- No other founder board seats

**Pros:**
- Streamlined decision-making
- CEO has clear authority

**Cons:**
- Co-founders may feel disenfranchised
- Lacks founder representation diversity

**Recommendation:** ✅ ADOPT Option B—2 founders + 1 independent (Control Preservation + future scalability)

---

#### Post-Series A Board Structure

**Option A: Founder Majority (3 Founders, 1 Investor, 1 Independent)**
- 5-person board: 3 founder seats, 1 investor seat, 1 independent
- Founders retain control

**Pros:**
- Founders maintain board control post-Series A
- Investor has representation but not control

**Cons:**
- Investors often resist minority board representation at significant investment
- May reduce investor appeal

**Option B: Balanced Board (2 Founders, 2 Investors, 1 Independent) - RECOMMENDED**
- 5-person board: 2 founder seats, 2 investor seats, 1 independent (tiebreaker)
- Neither side has majority

**Pros:**
- Balanced power structure (neither side dominates)
- Independent director breaks ties objectively
- Standard for Series A in Nordic markets
- Demonstrates fairness to investors

**Cons:**
- Founders lose board majority
- Independent director becomes kingmaker

**Option C: Investor Majority (2 Founders, 3 Investors)**
- Investors control board at Series A

**Pros:**
- Maximum investor protection

**Cons:**
- Founders lose control too early
- Creates adversarial dynamic

**Recommendation:** ✅ ADOPT Option B—balanced board (Investor Readiness + Control Preservation through economics)

---

### Board Scaling Roadmap

**Recommended Evolution:**

**Pre-Series A: 3-person board**
- 2 founder directors (Emil + 1 co-founder, or Emil + rotating)
- 1 independent director

**Series A: 5-person board**
- 2 founder directors
- 2 investor directors (lead investor + co-investor, or lead gets 2 seats)
- 1 independent director (mutual agreement or founders nominate)

**Series B: 7-person board**
- 2 founder directors
- 3-4 investor directors (Series A + Series B investors)
- 1-2 independent directors

**Logic:**
- Founders maintain meaningful representation (≥28% of board)
- Investors gain proportional representation based on ownership
- Independent directors provide objective perspective
- Board doesn't grow too large (max 7 keeps it functional)

---

### Board Election Mechanisms

**Recommended Approach:**

**Founder Directors:**
- Elected by founders collectively (majority of founder shares)
- Typically Emil (CEO) gets one seat automatically
- Second seat elected by all founders (could be Anton, Yuri, or rotational)

**Investor Directors:**
- Elected by investor shares as a class
- Lead investor typically gets seat (or 2 seats at significant ownership)
- Investor directors chosen by investors (not founder vote)

**Independent Directors:**
- Elected by majority of all shareholders (founders + investors vote together)
- OR nominated by founders, approved by board
- Should be truly independent (no financial interest beyond director fees)

**Removal:**
- Each director removable by the class that elected them
- Founders can remove founder directors (majority of founder shares)
- Investors can remove investor directors (majority of investor shares)
- Independent directors require majority of all shareholders

---

### Observer Rights

**Definition:** Right to attend board meetings without voting power.

**Considerations:**
- Some investors request observer rights (especially if don't get board seat)
- Observers receive all board materials, participate in discussions, but don't vote
- Can create confidentiality concerns

**Recommendation:**
- Pre-Series A: No observer rights (no investors yet)
- Series A: Consider granting to major investor if they don't receive board seat
- Limit to 1-2 observers maximum
- Observers bound by same confidentiality as directors
- Observers can be excluded from executive sessions at board's discretion

(d) The Board Observer may be excluded from executive sessions at the discretion of the voting directors.

### Scenario Analysis

**Scenario 1: Founder Dispute (Pre-Series A)**
- 3-person board: 2 founders + 1 independent
- Founders Emil and Anton disagree on hiring VP Sales
- Independent director breaks tie based on merits

**Scenario 2: Major Decision (Post-Series A)**
- 5-person board: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent
- Decision: Sell company for €8M
- 2 founders vote yes, 2 investors vote no (want to continue growing)
- Independent director decides (acts as tiebreaker)

**Scenario 3: Board Scales to Series B**
- Company raises Series B (€10M)
- Board expands from 5 → 7 members
- 2 founder directors remain
- 1 Series B investor director added (now 3 investor directors total)
- 2 independent directors (added second for balance)

---

### Negotiation Strategy

**Opening Position:**
- Pre-Series A: 2 founders + 1 independent (3 total)
- Series A: 2 founders + 2 investors + 1 independent (5 total)
- Founders elect founder directors, investors elect investor directors
- Independent elected by all shareholders

**Fallback Position:**
- Accept 3 founders on pre-Series A board (if co-founders demand representation)
- Accept 2 founders + 3 investors at Series A (if investors demand majority)
- Accept investor-nominated independent director (with founder approval)

**Red Lines:**
- Will not accept investor board majority pre-Series A (no investors yet!)
- Will not accept <2 founder directors post-Series A (need meaningful representation)
- Will not accept removal of all founder directors by investor vote alone

**Talking Points:**
1. "Balanced 2-2-1 board structure is standard for Nordic Series A investments"
2. "Independent director provides objective perspective and breaks ties fairly"
3. "Board scales naturally through funding rounds without requiring SA amendment"
4. "Founders maintain meaningful representation (40% of board) even after multiple rounds"

**Anticipated Objections & Responses:**

*Objection 1:* "Investors want board majority at Series A"
*Response:* "Balanced board is Nordic standard. Investors have strong protections through reserved matters (veto rights). Board majority isn't necessary for protection, and balanced structure maintains founder operational focus."

*Objection 2:* "Independent director is unnecessary expense pre-Series A"
*Response:* "Independent director brings valuable outside perspective and demonstrates governance sophistication to future investors. We can find qualified advisor willing to serve for equity compensation."

*Objection 3:* "Why do founders get 2 seats when investors might own 40%?"
*Response:* "Founders are operators building the company day-to-day. Board representation isn't purely proportional to ownership—it's about balancing operational leadership with investor oversight. Independent director ensures investors' voices are heard objectively."

---

### Validation Against Principles

✅ **Founder Alignment:** Board structure treats all founders fairly; election mechanism is democratic among founders
✅ **Investor Readiness:** Balanced post-Series A board is Nordic standard; signals professionalism
✅ **Operational Autonomy:** Founders maintain enough board representation to approve operational decisions
✅ **Control Preservation:** Founders control board pre-Series A; balanced thereafter but retain meaningful voice
✅ **Fair Exit:** Board structure ensures fair consideration of exit opportunities
✅ **Dispute Efficiency:** Independent director breaks ties; clear election/removal procedures
✅ **Evolution Design:** Explicit scaling roadmap prevents future conflicts

**Result: VALIDATED - Board structure aligns with all principles**

## 1.3 Voting Rights & Reserved Matters

### Decision Points
1. Voting rights structure (per-share vs class-based)
2. Reserved matters requiring supermajority or special approval
3. Protective provisions (investor veto rights)
4. Dual-class share structure (now vs future)

### Voting Rights Structure Options

**Option A: One Share, One Vote (Current Standard)**
- Each share carries equal voting rights
- Simple, transparent, investor-friendly

**Pros:**
- Standard structure, investor expectation
- Easy to understand and administer
- Proportional voting (% ownership = % voting power)

**Cons:**
- Founders lose voting control as they dilute

**Option B: Dual-Class Shares (Founder Control)**
- Ordinary Shares: 1 vote per share (held by investors)
- Super-Voting Shares: 10 votes per share (held by founders)
- Founders maintain voting control despite ownership dilution

**Example:**
- Series A: Investors own 20% (ordinary shares with 1:1 voting)
- Founders own 80% (super-voting shares with 10:1 voting)
- Total votes: Investors (20), Founders (800) = Founders control 97.6% of votes

**Pros:**
- Founders maintain control through multiple funding rounds
- Can raise capital without losing decision-making power
- Standard in tech companies (Google, Facebook, Airbnb, etc.)

**Cons:**
- Some investors dislike dual-class (perceive as founder entrenchment)
- Complicates voting calculations
- May reduce company value at IPO (some indices exclude dual-class)

**Market Context:**
- Common in U.S. tech companies
- Less common in Europe historically, but gaining adoption
- Nordic investors increasingly accept dual-class for strong founding teams

---

### Recommended Approach: Staged Implementation

**Pre-Series A:** One share, one vote (simple, investor-ready)

**Series A Onwards:** Implement dual-class shares

**Rationale:**
1. Pre-investment, all founders have one share class (no need for complexity)
2. At Series A, convert founder shares to super-voting (10:1)
3. Issue ordinary shares (1:1) to investors
4. Founders maintain voting control despite dilution

**Implementation:**
- Include provision in current SA stating intent to implement dual-class at Series A
- Requires Articles of Association amendment at Series A (board + shareholder approval)
- Conversion mechanism clearly defined

**RECOMMENDED: Include dual-class provision in SA, implement at Series A**

---

### Reserved Matters (Investor Veto Rights)

**Philosophy:** Balance investor protection with operational autonomy.

**Reserved Matters Framework:**

#### Tier 1: Fundamental Changes (100% Shareholder Approval)
These matters are so significant that ALL shareholders must agree:

1. Sale, merger, or liquidation of the Company
2. Amendment of Articles of Association
3. Issuance of shares senior to or pari passu with Series A Preference Shares
4. Change of business purpose (e.g., pivot from medical device compliance to different industry)

**Rationale:** Fundamental changes to company structure or purpose affect all shareholders equally.

---

#### Tier 2: Material Decisions (Investor Class Approval)
These matters require approval of majority of investor shares as a separate class:

1. Issuance of new shares (including options >X% of option pool)
2. Incurrence of debt >€[500,000]
3. Acquisition or disposition of assets >€[500,000]
4. Material contracts with annual value >€[250,000]
5. Hiring or termination of CEO
6. Related party transactions >€[50,000]
7. Declaration of dividends
8. Licensing or sale of material intellectual property
9. Changes to option pool size or terms

**Rationale:** These decisions significantly affect investor value or risk profile, so investors should have veto right.

---

#### Tier 3: Board Approval Only
These matters require board approval (not full shareholder approval):

1. Annual budget and business plan
2. Capital expenditures within budget up to €[250,000]
3. Contracts within ordinary course of business <€[250,000] annual value
4. Hiring/termination of senior management (below CEO level)
5. Quarterly financial statements
6. Bank account authorization
7. Legal settlements <€[100,000]

**Rationale:** Significant enough for board oversight, but not requiring full shareholder vote.

---

#### Tier 4: CEO Autonomous Authority
These matters are within CEO's authority without approval:

1. Day-to-day operational decisions
2. Hiring/termination of non-senior employees
3. Contracts within ordinary course <€[50,000] annual value
4. Expenditures within approved budget <€[25,000] per transaction
5. Vendor relationships and partnerships (non-exclusive, non-material)

**Rationale:** CEO must be able to operate company effectively without seeking approval for routine decisions.

---

### Threshold Recommendations

**Critical Parameters to Define:**

| Decision Category | Recommended Threshold |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Material Contracts | €250,000 annual value |
| Capital Expenditures | €250,000 per transaction |
| Debt Incurrence | €500,000 total |
| Asset Acquisition/Disposal | €500,000 per transaction |
| Related Party Transactions | €50,000 per transaction |
| Legal Settlements | €100,000 per matter |
| CEO Autonomous Contracts | <€50,000 annual value |
| CEO Autonomous Expenditures | <€25,000 per transaction |
| Senior Management Hiring | ≥€100,000 annual salary |

**Rationale for Thresholds:**
- High enough to prevent operational paralysis (Martin's draft used €6,700—absurdly low)
- Low enough to protect investors from major decisions without oversight
- Benchmarked to Regla's expected revenue/spending scale (€1-5M ARR stage)

**Adjustment Mechanism:**
- Thresholds should be reviewed annually and adjusted for company growth
- Example: At €10M ARR, raise thresholds proportionally (2x or 3x)

### Implementation Language

**RECOMMENDED CLAUSE:**

```markdown
**Section Z: Reserved Matters and Approval Requirements**

### Scenario Analysis

**Scenario 1: CEO Hiring Junior Developer**
- Salary: €60,000/year
- Threshold: CEO autonomous <€100K
- **Result:** CEO hires without approval ✅

**Scenario 2: CEO Entering SaaS Contract**
- Annual value: €75,000
- Threshold: CEO autonomous <€50K; Board approval €50K-€250K
- **Result:** Requires board approval (not full shareholder) ✅

**Scenario 3: Company Raising Debt**
- Amount: €400,000 bank loan
- Threshold: Board approval €100K-€500K; Investor approval >€500K
- **Result:** Board approves (no investor veto) ✅

**Scenario 4: Company Considering Acquisition Offer**
- Offer: €8M for 100% of company
- Threshold: Sale requires 75% shareholder approval
- **Result:** All shareholders vote (founders + investors) ✅

**Scenario 5: Issuing New Shares to Strategic Investor**
- New investment: €2M Series A
- Threshold: Investor class approval (protective provision)
- **Result:** Existing investors (if any) must approve new share issuance ✅

---

### Negotiation Strategy

**Opening Position:**
- Reserved matters limited to truly material decisions (Z.2 list above)
- High thresholds for approvals (€250K contracts, €500K debt)
- CEO autonomous authority clearly defined and protected
- Dual-class shares provision included for future implementation

**Fallback Position:**
- Accept lower thresholds (€150K contracts, €250K debt) if investor insists
- Accept longer list of reserved matters if industry-standard items (e.g., option pool changes)
- Accept requiring investor approval for senior management hires (not just CEO)

**Red Lines:**
- Will not accept unanimous consent for routine decisions (learned from Martin's draft)
- Will not accept thresholds as low as €6,700 (operational paralysis)
- Will not accept investor veto on day-to-day operations
- Will not accept elimination of CEO autonomous authority

**Talking Points:**
1. "Reserved matters list protects investors on major decisions while preserving operational flexibility"
2. "Thresholds are calibrated to Regla's stage—€250K contracts are material at our scale"
3. "CEO needs autonomy for day-to-day decisions to compete effectively in fast-moving market"
4. "Dual-class shares are increasingly common in Nordic markets and preserve founder vision"

**Anticipated Objections & Responses:**

*Objection 1:* "We want lower thresholds—€100K contracts are material"
*Response:* "€100K annual contracts are within ordinary course for B2B SaaS at our stage. We expect typical customer contracts in €50-150K range. Board approval for every customer deal would create sales bottleneck. Happy to compromise at €150K if that addresses your concern."

*Objection 2:* "We want approval rights for all senior hires, not just CEO"
*Response:* "We included CEO in reserved matters because CEO change affects company direction. Senior hires (VPs) require board approval, which includes your director. That provides sufficient oversight without micromanaging hiring process."

*Objection 3:* "Dual-class shares reduce alignment between founders and investors"
*Response:* "Dual-class preserves founder vision while allowing capital raising. Google, Facebook, Airbnb all used this structure successfully. Economic interests remain aligned (founders want high exit price), but control prevents short-term pressures that damage long-term value."

---

### Validation Against Principles

✅ **Founder Alignment:** Reserved matters apply equally to all; no founder can unilaterally make protected decisions
✅ **Investor Readiness:** Reserved matters list is market-standard; protects investors appropriately
✅ **Operational Autonomy:** CEO has clear autonomous authority; thresholds prevent paralysis
✅ **Control Preservation:** Dual-class shares preserve founder voting control despite dilution
✅ **Fair Exit:** 75% threshold for sale ensures minority can't force bad deal but supermajority can proceed
✅ **Dispute Efficiency:** Clear approval requirements prevent disputes over authority
✅ **Evolution Design:** Thresholds adjustable as company scales; structure accommodates future rounds

**Result: VALIDATED - Voting/reserved matters structure aligns with all principles**
