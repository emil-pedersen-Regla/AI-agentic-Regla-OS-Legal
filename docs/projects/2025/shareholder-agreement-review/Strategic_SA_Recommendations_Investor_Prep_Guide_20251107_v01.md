# PART I: INVESTOR PSYCHOLOGY & MESSAGING

## Understanding Investor Concerns

### What Investors Fear

**Fear #1: Founder Lack of Commitment**
- **Concern**: "Will founders stick around long enough to build value?"
- **Evidence They Look For**: Vesting schedules, cliff periods, acceleration terms
- **What Triggers Fear**: No vesting, short vesting periods, immediate 100% ownership

**Fear #2: Misaligned Incentives**
- **Concern**: "Do founders want to build big company or cash out early?"
- **Evidence They Look For**: Liquidation preference structure, exit provisions
- **What Triggers Fear**: Participating preferences (founder wants early exit), low drag-along thresholds

**Fear #3: Operational Chaos**
- **Concern**: "Can this team execute? Will founder disputes paralyze the company?"
- **Evidence They Look For**: Governance structure, decision-making mechanisms, deadlock provisions
- **What Triggers Fear**: Unanimous consent requirements, no tiebreaker mechanisms, all founders on board with no structure

**Fear #4: Future Difficulty Raising Capital**
- **Concern**: "Will Series B investors face problems with this SA structure?"
- **Evidence They Look For**: Standard terms, scalability provisions, clean cap table
- **What Triggers Fear**: Non-standard terms, unusual share classes, complex ownership structures

**Fear #5: Founder Over-Protection**
- **Concern**: "Are founders too defensive? Will they resist reasonable investor oversight?"
- **Evidence They Look For**: Reserved matters, board structure, information rights
- **What Triggers Fear**: No investor board seats, minimal reserved matters, excessive founder control mechanisms

---

## Your Positioning Narrative

### The Story You Tell

**Opening Frame:**
"Regla's Shareholder Agreement is structured to balance three objectives: strong founder commitment, professional governance, and investor protection. We've used Nordic market standards throughout to ensure Series A investors see familiar, institutional-quality terms."

---

### Key Messages (Customize to Your SA)

#### Message 1: Founder Commitment (Addresses Fear #1)

**The Message:**
"All three founders have 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff—the universal standard. This demonstrates our long-term commitment to building significant value."

**Supporting Points:**
- "We included double-trigger acceleration to protect us post-acquisition, but only if we're terminated—if we stay, we continue vesting normally"
- "Emil's 25% immediate vesting recognizes 8 months of pre-incorporation work while maintaining alignment going forward"
- "All founders vest on the same schedule from April 2025, ensuring equal future incentives"

**Investor Takeaway:**
✅ Founders are committed for 4 years
✅ Standard structure (no red flags)
✅ Reasonable acceleration (not excessive)

---

#### Message 2: Incentive Alignment (Addresses Fear #2)

**The Message:**
"We've adopted 1x non-participating liquidation preference—the Nordic standard—which aligns our incentives perfectly. We both benefit from building a large, valuable company."

**Supporting Points:**
- "With non-participating structure, the bigger the exit, the more we all make on a pro-rata basis"
- "75% drag-along threshold ensures we can execute beneficial transactions while preventing minority-forced sales"
- "No participating preference means we're not incentivized toward early, sub-optimal exits"

**Investor Takeaway:**
✅ Founder-investor incentives aligned
✅ Standard Nordic structure
✅ Reasonable exit provisions

---

#### Message 3: Professional Governance (Addresses Fear #3)

**The Message:**
"We've established a professional governance structure that scales naturally through funding rounds and includes clear decision-making mechanisms."

**Supporting Points:**
- "Pre-Series A: 2 founder directors + 1 independent for outside perspective"
- "At Series A: Board expands to 5 (2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent)—balanced structure where neither side controls"
- "Clear decision authority: CEO handles day-to-day operations, board approves material decisions (>€250K), shareholders approve fundamental changes"
- "Deadlock mechanisms in place: CEO tiebreaker (overridable by 2/3) and arbitration process"

**Investor Takeaway:**
✅ Sophisticated governance structure
✅ Clear decision-making authority
✅ Deadlock mechanisms prevent paralysis
✅ Investor board representation built in

---

#### Message 4: Investment Readiness (Addresses Fear #4)

**The Message:**
"Our SA is designed with Series A and beyond in mind. All terms are market-standard and scale naturally without requiring renegotiation."

**Supporting Points:**
- "10% ESOP reserved pre-investment (shows we're planning for team growth)"
- "Dual-class share provision included for future implementation (preserves founder vision while raising capital)"
- "Board scaling roadmap: 3 → 5 at Series A → 7 at Series B (clear evolution path)"
- "Standard anti-dilution protection (broad-based weighted average) protects Series A investors in down rounds"

**Investor Takeaway:**
✅ Forward-thinking structure
✅ No renegotiation needed in Series A
✅ Clean path for future rounds
✅ Team growth planned (ESOP)

---

#### Message 5: Balanced Protection (Addresses Fear #5)

**The Message:**
"We've included standard investor protective provisions while maintaining operational flexibility—balanced approach that protects both parties."

**Supporting Points:**
- "Reserved matters cover material decisions: capital raises, large contracts (>€250K), CEO hire/fire, major IP decisions"
- "But: CEO retains operational autonomy for day-to-day decisions (<€50K contracts, non-senior hiring, routine expenditures)"
- "Investors receive standard information rights (quarterly financials, annual budgets, material updates)"
- "Clean governance: no unanimous consent requirements, no operational paralysis"

**Investor Takeaway:**
✅ Reasonable investor protections
✅ Operational flexibility preserved
✅ Standard information rights
✅ Not overly founder-defensive

### Complete 2-Minute Pitch

**Situation:** Investor asks "Walk me through your shareholder agreement structure"

**Your Response:**

"Our SA is structured around Nordic market standards with three key elements:

**First, founder commitment**: All three founders have 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff—universal standard. We included reasonable double-trigger acceleration (acquisition + termination), but only 100% if we're let go—retention incentive remains. This demonstrates we're committed for the long term.

**Second, aligned economics**: We've adopted 1x non-participating liquidation preference—the Nordic standard. This means we're all incentivized to build a big company. With non-participating, the higher the exit, the more we all benefit on a pro-rata basis. 75% drag-along threshold allows beneficial exits while preventing minority-forced sales.

**Third, professional governance**: Pre-Series A, we have 2 founders plus 1 independent director. At Series A, the board expands to 5: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent—balanced structure. Clear decision authority: I handle day-to-day operations, board approves material decisions over €250K, shareholders approve fundamental changes. Reserved matters cover what investors expect—capital raises, major contracts, CEO changes, IP decisions—while I maintain operational flexibility for routine decisions.

**The bottom line**: We've built an institutional-quality SA using market standards that scales naturally through Series A and beyond. No unusual terms that will create friction in future rounds. We're investor-ready."

**Estimated Response Length:** 90-120 seconds

# PART II: TERM-BY-TERM INVESTOR APPEAL ANALYSIS

## How Each Provision Signals to Investors

### Vesting Schedule: 4-Year with 1-Year Cliff

**Investor View:** ✅ **POSITIVE** (Strong Signal)

**What It Signals:**
- Founders understand market standards
- Commitment to long-term value creation
- Founders have done their homework (this is universal)

**Investor Internal Thought:**
"Good, they're not fighting the standard. Shows they're sophisticated and committed. No red flag here."

**How to Present:**
"We've adopted the standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff that all VC-backed companies use. This demonstrates our commitment to building long-term value and ensures we're all aligned on the time horizon."

**If Investor Questions:**
- Q: "Why not 3 years?" → A: "4 years is the global standard. We want to signal commitment aligned with investor expectations."
- Q: "What about Emil's immediate vesting?" → A: "That recognizes 8 months of pre-incorporation work. Going forward, all founders vest on the same 4-year schedule."

---

### Liquidation Preference: 1x Non-Participating

**Investor View:** ✅ **POSITIVE** (Standard Nordic Term)

**What It Signals:**
- Aligned incentives (both benefit from larger exits)
- Nordic market awareness (this is the standard)
- Not seeking excessive founder protection

**Investor Internal Thought:**
"Perfect. Non-participating is standard in Nordics. Shows they want to build a big company, not optimize for early exits. Our economics are protected in downside, we participate in upside."

**How to Present:**
"We've structured the liquidation preference as 1x non-participating—the prevailing standard in 78% of Nordic Series A rounds according to byFounders data. This aligns our incentives perfectly: we both benefit from building the biggest possible company."

**Financial Example to Share:**
"At a €10M exit, you get your €2M back as preference, we get €8M. At a €20M exit, you convert and take 20% (€4M), we get 80% (€16M). We're both incentivized to maximize valuation."

**If Investor Questions:**
- Q: "Why not participating?" → A: "Participating creates misalignment—reduces our upside without additional benefit to you. Non-participating is Nordic standard and aligns our interests."
- Q: "Can we do 1.5x or 2x multiple?" → A: "1x is market standard for Series A. Higher multiples are uncommon in Nordics and would be a red flag to Series B investors."

---

### Drag-Along Threshold: 75%

**Investor View:** ✅ **POSITIVE** (Balanced Protection)

**What It Signals:**
- Supermajority required prevents minority blocking
- Reasonable threshold (not too high, not too low)
- Founders understand need for exit flexibility

**Investor Internal Thought:**
"75% is standard. We'll have meaningful say in exit decisions but can't force a sale alone. Fair balance."

**How to Present:**
"We've set drag-along at 75%—the Nordic standard—which requires broad consensus for a sale. At our 70% founder / 30% Series A investor structure, this means you plus 2 of 3 founders can execute a beneficial transaction, or all 3 founders can proceed, but no minority can force a bad deal."

**Protection You Get (Don't Lead With This, But Know It):**
"At 75% threshold with you at 30%, you can't force a sale with just one founder (would only be 50-55%). You need 2 of 3 founders on board—which is appropriate for a major company decision."

**If Investor Questions:**
- Q: "Why not 60%?" → A: "75-80% is Nordic standard per byFounders. Lower thresholds create risk of minority-forced sales. 75% ensures broad consensus, which benefits everyone."
- Q: "What if we can't reach 75%?" → A: "Then the transaction doesn't proceed, which is appropriate—sale of the entire company should require supermajority support."

---

### Board Composition: 2-2-1 Structure at Series A

**Investor View:** ✅ **POSITIVE** (Standard, Balanced)

**What It Signals:**
- Professional governance understanding
- Willingness to share control appropriately
- Balanced structure (neither side dominates)

**Investor Internal Thought:**
"Standard structure. We get meaningful board representation without founder entrenchment. Independent can break ties objectively. This works."

**How to Present:**
"At Series A, the board expands from 3 to 5: 2 founder directors, 2 investor directors, 1 independent director. This is the standard Nordic structure—balanced board where neither side controls, and the independent provides objective perspective."

**Governance Narrative:**
"Pre-investment, we have 2 founders plus 1 independent to get outside perspective early. At Series A, you add 2 directors and we maintain our 2 seats. The independent acts as tiebreaker on 2-2 splits, ensuring decisions are made on merits."

**If Investor Questions:**
- Q: "Why not investor majority (3 investors, 2 founders)?" → A: "Balanced board is Nordic standard for Series A. As founders building day-to-day, we need meaningful representation. Reserved matters give you veto on major decisions, and board balance ensures healthy collaboration."
- Q: "Can we appoint the independent?" → A: "We propose independent elected by all shareholders (mutual approval). This ensures they're truly independent, not aligned with either side."

---

### Reserved Matters: Standard List

**Investor View:** ✅ **POSITIVE** (Appropriate Protection)

**What It Signals:**
- Understanding of investor protection needs
- Willingness to accept reasonable oversight
- Clear distinction between material vs routine decisions

**Investor Internal Thought:**
"Standard reserved matters list—capital raises, large contracts, CEO changes, IP decisions. Everything we'd expect to have a say in. And CEO still has operational autonomy, so company can move fast on routine decisions. Good balance."

**How to Present:**
"We've included standard investor protective provisions that require your consent as a class: capital raises, new share issuances, large contracts over €250K, CEO hire/fire, major IP decisions, material debt, and fundamental changes like sale or liquidation."

**Operational Flexibility Narrative:**
"But we've been careful to preserve operational autonomy for routine decisions. I have CEO authority for contracts under €50K, hiring non-senior staff, and day-to-day expenditures under €25K within approved budget. Board approval for material decisions €50K-€250K. This prevents operational paralysis while giving you oversight on what matters."

**Threshold Logic:**
"We've calibrated thresholds to Regla's stage. At €250K annual contracts and €500K debt limits, you have meaningful oversight without micromanaging routine operations. As we scale, these thresholds can be adjusted proportionally."

**If Investor Questions:**
- Q: "We want lower thresholds (€100K contracts)" → A: "Our B2B SaaS contracts typically range €50-150K annually. Board approval for every customer deal creates sales bottlenecks. Happy to compromise at €150K if that addresses your concern, but €50K is too low for efficient operations."
- Q: "We want approval for all senior hires" → A: "CEO hire/fire is in reserved matters because it affects company direction. Senior hires require board approval, which includes your director—that's sufficient oversight without creating hiring bottlenecks."

---

### Double-Trigger Acceleration: 100%

**Investor View:** ⚠️ **NEUTRAL to SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE** (May Negotiate)

**What It Signals:**
- Founders are protecting against post-acquisition termination
- Understanding of acquisition dynamics
- Possibly: Concern about being let go

**Investor Internal Thought:**
"100% is founder-favorable. We'd prefer 50-75%. But it's double-trigger, so acquirer controls whether it happens. Not a deal-breaker, but we'll probably negotiate down to 75%."

**How to Present:**
"We've included 100% double-trigger acceleration—meaning acquisition PLUS termination without cause within 12 months. This only triggers if we're let go, so there's still strong retention incentive for us to stay."

**Rationale to Share:**
"Double-trigger protects us if we're terminated after building acquisition value, which is fair. But it doesn't trigger if we stay and continue contributing, so acquirer has full control. This is about fairness, not reducing commitment."

**Be Prepared to Compromise:**
"We understand 75% is more common and would be open to that compromise if it's important to you. Our priority is having SOME protection, not necessarily 100%."

**If Investor Questions:**
- Q: "Why not 50%?" → A: "We'd accept 75% as a compromise. 50% means we lose half our unvested value if terminated post-acquisition, which doesn't adequately protect the value we've built."
- Q: "Acquirers don't like acceleration" → A: "Acquirers control whether this triggers by choosing whether to keep or terminate us. If they keep us (which is typically the plan), acceleration never happens. It only protects us if we're let go, which is fair."

# PART III: RENEGOTIABLE VS PROTECTED TERMS

## What WILL Change in Series A (Expected Evolution)

These terms are designed to evolve and investors should expect to renegotiate:

### Board Composition ✅ WILL CHANGE
**Now (Pre-Investment):**
- 3 directors: 2 founders + 1 independent

**Series A:**
- 5 directors: 2 founders + 2 investors + 1 independent

**Series B:**
- 7 directors: 2 founders + 3-4 investors + 1-2 independents

**Message to Investors:**
"Board naturally expands with each round. We've designed the scaling roadmap into our SA."

---

### Reserved Matters ✅ WILL EXPAND
**Now (Pre-Investment):**
- Minimal list (fundamental changes only)

**Series A:**
- Standard list (capital raises, material contracts, CEO changes, IP decisions)

**Series B:**
- May expand further based on Series B investor requirements

**Message to Investors:**
"Reserved matters expand as more capital is at risk. Our current minimal list is appropriate pre-investment, and we'll add standard investor protections at Series A."

---

### Information Rights ✅ WILL INCREASE
**Now:**
- No formal information rights (no external investors)

**Series A:**
- Quarterly financials, annual budget, material updates, board observer optional

**Series B:**
- May add monthly reporting, detailed metrics

**Message to Investors:**
"We're prepared to provide standard information rights at Series A—quarterly financials, annual budgets, material event notifications. This is expected and we're set up to deliver."

---

### Share Classes ✅ WILL ADD PREFERENCE SHARES
**Now:**
- Single class (Ordinary Shares)

**Series A:**
- Two classes: Ordinary (founders) + Series A Preference (investors)

**Series B:**
- Three classes: Ordinary + Series A Preference + Series B Preference

**Message to Investors:**
"Share class structure evolves with each round. Our Articles of Association are set up to accommodate preference shares at Series A. Standard preference terms: 1x liquidation preference, participation in distributions post-preference, anti-dilution protection."

---

## What Should NOT Change (Protected Terms)

These terms are part of the foundation and should remain consistent:

### Founder Vesting Schedule ⛔ SHOULD NOT CHANGE
**Why Protected:**
- Vesting demonstrates commitment (investors want this)
- Already market standard (4-year/1-year cliff)
- Changing it suggests founders aren't committed

**If Investor Requests Change:**
"Our founder vesting is already the universal standard—4 years with 1-year cliff. This demonstrates our commitment and is exactly what future investors will expect. Changing it would actually raise red flags."

**Acceptable Modification:**
- Adjusting acceleration percentage (100% → 75%)
- Extending acceleration window (12 months → 18 months)

**Unacceptable:**
- Extending vesting period (4 years → 5-6 years)
- Adding second cliff
- Removing acceleration entirely

---

### Liquidation Preference Structure ⛔ SHOULD NOT CHANGE
**Why Protected:**
- 1x non-participating is Nordic standard
- Changing to participating misaligns incentives
- Already investor-protective in downside

**If Investor Requests Participating:**
"Non-participating 1x is the prevailing standard in 78% of Nordic Series A rounds per byFounders data. Participating structure would misalign our incentives—we'd be less motivated to build a large company. For you, non-participating still provides full downside protection (you get your €2M back in modest exits) while ensuring we're both optimally motivated for larger outcomes."

**Acceptable Modification:**
- None (this is the standard)

**Unacceptable:**
- Participating preference (creates misalignment)
- Higher multiple (2x, 1.5x) for Series A
- Stacked preferences that subordinate founders

---

### Drag-Along Threshold ⛔ SHOULD NOT CHANGE (Much)
**Why Protected:**
- 75-80% is standard supermajority
- Lower threshold allows minority-forced sales
- Balance needed between exit flexibility and founder protection

**If Investor Requests 60%:**
"75% is the Nordic standard for drag-along rights per byFounders research. At 60%, minority shareholders (potentially you plus just one founder) could force a sale against the will of the majority of founders. For a decision as significant as selling the entire company, supermajority consensus is appropriate. This protects everyone—including you—from bad deals forced through by a slim majority."

**Acceptable Modification:**
- 75% → 70% (slight reduction, still reasonable)

**Unacceptable:**
- <67% (below 2/3 supermajority)
- Investor-only drag rights

---

### Good/Bad Leaver Definitions ⛔ SHOULD NOT CHANGE (Principles)
**Why Protected:**
- Vested shares should not be subject to par value buyback
- Good leaver deserves fair value for time served
- Bad leaver provisions already punitive (unvested at par value)

**If Investor Requests Harsher Bad Leaver Terms:**
"Our good/bad leaver provisions follow market standards: unvested shares are subject to repurchase (at time-pro-rated FMV for good leavers, at par value for bad leavers), but vested shares remain the property of the departing founder at fair market value. This is critical—vested shares have been earned through service performed and should not be subject to punitive buybacks."

"The alternative (allowing par value buyback of vested shares) creates unconscionable outcomes. A founder who builds €10M of value over 3 years and is then terminated shouldn't lose €9.999M by having shares bought at €1,000 par value. Vested means earned."

**Acceptable Modifications:**
- Adjusting good leaver time-pro-ration percentage (100% → 75%)
- Extending ROFR period (12 months → 24 months)

**Unacceptable:**
- Par value buyback of vested shares (unconscionable)
- No time-pro-ration for good leavers (unfair)
- Bad leaver applies to voluntary departures without misconduct

---

## Positioning Protected Terms

**Frame:** "Investor-Protective vs Founder-Exploitative"

**Your Message:**
"Our SA includes all standard investor protective provisions—reserved matters, board representation, information rights, liquidation preference, anti-dilution protection. We're not seeking to avoid reasonable investor oversight.

But we've drawn clear lines around terms that would be exploitative rather than protective. For example, allowing par value buyback of vested shares doesn't protect your investment—it simply creates punitive founder downside that could harm recruitment and motivation.

Similarly, moving from 1x non-participating to participating doesn't provide you additional downside protection (you already get your capital back in modest exits). It just reduces founder economics and creates misalignment.

Our philosophy: accept all protections, resist exploitation."

---

# PART IV: RED FLAGS TO AVOID

## What Scares Investors Away

### Red Flag #1: Unrealistic Valuation Expectations

**What It Looks Like:**
- Founders insist on €10M pre-money valuation with no revenue
- Refusing to accept market-rate dilution
- Anchor to inflated valuations from other companies

**Why It's a Red Flag:**
"Shows founders don't understand market realities, may be difficult to work with, could have unrealistic expectations throughout relationship"

**How We Avoid:**
✅ "We're seeking market-appropriate valuation based on our stage, traction, and comparable companies. We understand first institutional round typically involves 20-30% dilution and we're comfortable with that for the right partner."

---

### Red Flag #2: Overly Defensive Founders

**What It Looks Like:**
- Resistance to any investor oversight
- No reserved matters for investors
- Refusal to accept standard board representation
- Fighting every standard protection

**Why It's a Red Flag:**
"Suggests founders don't want to be held accountable, may hide problems, could be difficult partners"

**How We Avoid:**
✅ "We've proactively included standard investor protective provisions—reserved matters, board seats, information rights. We understand that investors need oversight and protection, and we've structured our SA to provide that while maintaining operational flexibility."

---

### Red Flag #3: Founder Conflict or Misalignment

**What It Looks Like:**
- Founders don't agree on strategy or terms
- Different vesting schedules suggesting unequal commitment
- One founder trying to dominate others
- Unexplained equity splits (huge disparities)

**Why It's a Red Flag:**
"Founder disputes are top cause of startup failure. Investors want teams that work well together and are aligned."

**How We Avoid:**
✅ "All three founders are fully aligned on our SA structure. We've discussed every major term, reached consensus, and documented our agreement. We have equal forward-looking vesting (all vest on same 4-year schedule from April 2025), balanced governance participation, and shared vision for building Regla."

---

### Red Flag #4: Unusual or Non-Standard Terms

**What It Looks Like:**
- Creative share structures that deviate from market norms
- Unusual vesting (2 years, 6 years, no cliff, strange acceleration)
- Non-standard governance (unusual voting, complex decision-making)
- Terms that will obviously need renegotiation in Series B

**Why It's a Red Flag:**
"Creates future friction, suggests founders don't know what they're doing or are trying to be too clever, makes investors worry about what else might be unusual"

**How We Avoid:**
✅ "We've systematically used Nordic market standards for every major term: 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (universal), 1x non-participating liquidation preference (78% of Nordic Series A), 75% drag-along (standard supermajority), 2-2-1 board structure at Series A (balanced governance). Series B investors will see familiar, comfortable terms."

---

### Red Flag #5: No Founder Vesting

**What It Looks Like:**
- Founders own 100% of shares immediately
- No earn-out, no commitment mechanism
- Arguments like "we already proved ourselves"

**Why It's a Red Flag:**
"THE biggest red flag. Signals lack of commitment, suggests founders might leave after getting investor capital, shows founders don't understand market standards"

**How We Avoid:**
✅ "All founders have 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff—the universal standard. This demonstrates our commitment to building long-term value and ensures we're aligned with investor expectations."

---

### Red Flag #6: Participating Liquidation Preference (In Founder SA)

**What It Looks Like:**
- Founders want participating preference for themselves
- OR: Founders fight against investor having participating preference by offering extreme alternatives

**Why It's a Red Flag:**
"If founders want participating, suggests they want to optimize for early exits rather than building big company. If founders fight it with extreme alternatives, suggests they're not being reasonable."

**How We Avoid:**
✅ "We've adopted 1x non-participating liquidation preference—the Nordic standard that aligns our incentives. This signals we're committed to building a large, valuable company where we all benefit on a pro-rata basis."

---

- Scalability built in
- Anticipation of Series B investor needs

**How We Demonstrate:**
✅ "Our board structure scales naturally: 3 → 5 at Series A → 7 at Series B"
✅ "We've reserved 10% ESOP pre-investment to signal we're planning for team growth"

## Final Message to Investors

**Your Closing Narrative:**

"We've spent significant time structuring Regla's Shareholder Agreement to balance three objectives: strong founder commitment, professional governance, and investor protection.

We've used Nordic market standards throughout—4-year vesting with 1-year cliff, 1x non-participating liquidation preference, 75% drag-along, balanced board structure—because we want Series A and Series B investors to see familiar, institutional-quality terms.

We've systematically avoided every red flag that typically concerns investors: no unusual terms, no excessive founder protection, no resistance to standard oversight.

And we've included all standard investor protective provisions: reserved matters, board representation, information rights, liquidation preference, anti-dilution protection.

The result is an SA that demonstrates our professionalism, signals our commitment, and provides you with the protection and oversight you need—while preserving our ability to build a large, valuable company.

We're investor-ready."
