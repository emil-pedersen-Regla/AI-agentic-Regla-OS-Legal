# PROVISION 1: FOUNDER VESTING

## Primary Recommended Language

```markdown
ARTICLE 4: FOUNDER VESTING

4.1 Vesting Schedule

(a) General Rule. Subject to Section 4.1(b), each Founder's Shares shall vest over a four (4) year period commencing on such Founder's Vesting Start Date (as defined in Section 4.1(c)), subject to the Founder's Continuous Service to the Company (as defined in Section 4.6).

(b) Vesting Mechanics. Each Founder's Shares shall vest as follows:

    (i) Cliff Period. Zero (0%) percent of the Shares shall vest prior to the first (1st) anniversary of the Vesting Start Date (the "Cliff Date").

    (ii) Cliff Vesting. On the Cliff Date, twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares shall vest, provided the Founder remains in Continuous Service through such date.

    (iii) Monthly Vesting. Following the Cliff Date, the remaining seventy-five percent (75%) of the Shares shall vest in thirty-six (36) equal monthly installments on the same day of each month as the Cliff Date, provided the Founder remains in Continuous Service through each such vesting date.

    (iv) Fully Vested. All Shares shall be fully vested on the four (4) year anniversary of the Vesting Start Date, provided the Founder remains in Continuous Service through such date.

(c) Vesting Start Dates. The "Vesting Start Date" for each Founder shall be:

    (i) Emil Timmreck Pedersen: April 1, 2025
    (ii) [Anton Full Name]: April 1, 2025
    (iii) [Yuri Full Name]: April 1, 2025

(d) Immediate Vesting for Emil Timmreck Pedersen. Notwithstanding Section 4.1(b), twenty-five percent (25%) of the Shares allocated to Emil Timmreck Pedersen shall vest immediately upon the Effective Date of this Agreement (the "Immediate Vesting"), in recognition of services performed to the Company during the period from August 15, 2024 to April 1, 2025. The remaining seventy-five percent (75%) of Emil Timmreck Pedersen's Shares shall vest in accordance with Section 4.1(b).

4.2 Acceleration of Vesting

(a) Double-Trigger Acceleration. If, within twelve (12) months following a Change of Control (as defined in Section 4.7), a Founder's Continuous Service is terminated either:

    (i) by the Company or any successor entity without Cause (as defined in Section 4.8); or

    (ii) by the Founder for Good Reason (as defined in Section 4.9);

then one hundred percent (100%) of such Founder's then-unvested Shares shall immediately vest and become non-forfeitable as of the date of such termination (the "Double-Trigger Acceleration").

(b) No Single-Trigger Acceleration. Except as expressly provided in Section 4.2(a), the occurrence of a Change of Control event alone shall not cause any acceleration of vesting. Vesting shall continue on the original schedule unless and until a termination event described in Section 4.2(a) occurs.

(c) Consideration of Accelerated Shares. Any Shares that vest pursuant to the Double-Trigger Acceleration shall be treated as vested Shares for all purposes under this Agreement, including for purposes of determining the treatment of such Shares upon a sale of the Company.

4.3 Treatment of Unvested Shares Upon Termination

(a) Vested Shares. All Shares that have vested as of the date of termination of a Founder's Continuous Service (including any Shares that vest pursuant to Section 4.2) shall remain the property of such Founder and shall not be subject to repurchase by the Company.

(b) Unvested Shares - Good Leaver. If a Founder's Continuous Service terminates and such Founder is classified as a Good Leaver pursuant to Section 4.10, all Shares that have not vested as of the date of termination shall be subject to the treatment set forth in Section 8 (Good Leaver Provisions).

(c) Unvested Shares - Bad Leaver. If a Founder's Continuous Service terminates and such Founder is classified as a Bad Leaver pursuant to Section 4.11, all Shares that have not vested as of the date of termination shall be subject to the treatment set forth in Section 9 (Bad Leaver Provisions).

4.4 Vesting Schedule Example

For illustrative purposes, assuming a Founder holds 1,200,000 Shares with a Vesting Start Date of April 1, 2025:

| Vesting Date | Vesting Event | Shares Vesting | Cumulative Vested |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| April 1, 2025 | Start Date | 0 | 0 (0%) |
| April 1, 2026 | Cliff (12 months) | 300,000 | 300,000 (25%) |
| May 1, 2026 | Month 13 | 25,000 | 325,000 (27.1%) |
| June 1, 2026 | Month 14 | 25,000 | 350,000 (29.2%) |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| April 1, 2029 | Fully Vested (48 months) | 25,000 | 1,200,000 (100%) |

4.5 No Fractional Shares

No fractional Shares shall vest under this Agreement. If the vesting calculation would result in a fractional Share, such fractional Share shall be rounded down to the nearest whole Share, with any remainder vesting on the final vesting date.

4.6 Continuous Service Defined

"Continuous Service" means the continuous service of a Founder to the Company as a director, officer, employee, or consultant, without any interruption or termination of such service. Continuous Service shall not be considered interrupted in the case of:

(a) approved leave of absence for military service, illness, or other approved purpose, provided the leave does not exceed ninety (90) days or, if longer, the Founder retains a right to reemployment with the Company by statute or contract; or

(b) transfers between service capacities (e.g., from employee to consultant), provided there is no break in service.

The Board of Directors shall determine whether Continuous Service has been interrupted and the effective date of such interruption.

4.7 Change of Control Defined

"Change of Control" means the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) a sale, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to a third party;

(b) a merger, consolidation, or similar transaction in which the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction do not, immediately after such transaction, hold at least fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity;

(c) a sale or transfer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Shares of the Company to a third party or group of related third parties in a single transaction or series of related transactions;

(d) a transaction or series of transactions in which a third party or group of related third parties acquires control of the Board of Directors of the Company; or

(e) the liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

For purposes of this definition, "third party" means any person or entity other than the Founders and their Affiliates.

4.8 Cause Defined

"Cause" means, with respect to a Founder:

(a) the Founder's conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or any crime involving fraud, embezzlement, or moral turpitude;

(b) the Founder's willful misconduct or gross negligence in the performance of the Founder's duties that is materially injurious to the Company;

(c) the Founder's material breach of this Agreement, the Articles of Association, or any employment or service agreement with the Company, which breach (if curable) remains uncured for thirty (30) days following written notice from the Company;

(d) the Founder's willful failure or refusal to perform the Founder's material duties (other than as a result of disability);

(e) fraud, misappropriation, or embezzlement by the Founder with respect to the Company's property or business;

(f) the Founder's material violation of the Company's written policies, including but not limited to policies relating to confidentiality, intellectual property, non-compete, anti-discrimination, or harassment; or

(g) any action by the Founder that brings or is reasonably likely to bring the Company into public disgrace or disrepute.

For purposes of this definition, no act or failure to act shall be considered "willful" unless done or omitted to be done by the Founder in bad faith and without a reasonable belief that such action or omission was in the best interests of the Company.

4.9 Good Reason Defined

"Good Reason" means, with respect to a Founder and without the Founder's express written consent:

(a) a material reduction in the Founder's base salary or target bonus opportunity (other than a general reduction affecting all senior executives proportionally);

(b) a material diminution in the Founder's title, authority, duties, or responsibilities;

(c) a relocation of the Founder's principal place of employment by more than fifty (50) kilometers; or

(d) any material breach by the Company of this Agreement, the Articles of Association, or any employment or service agreement with the Founder, which breach (if curable) remains uncured for thirty (30) days following written notice from the Founder.

To constitute Good Reason, the Founder must provide written notice to the Company of the condition giving rise to Good Reason within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such condition, and the Company must fail to cure such condition within thirty (30) days of receiving such notice. The Founder's termination must occur within sixty (60) days following the end of such cure period.

4.10 Good Leaver Defined

A "Good Leaver" is a Founder whose Continuous Service terminates under any of the following circumstances:

(a) termination by the Company without Cause;

(b) resignation by the Founder for Good Reason;

(c) death of the Founder;

(d) Permanent Disability of the Founder (as defined below); or

(e) mutual agreement of the Founder and the Company (evidenced by written agreement signed by both parties and approved by the Board of Directors) that the Founder shall be treated as a Good Leaver.

For purposes of this definition, "Permanent Disability" means the Founder's inability, due to physical or mental illness or injury, to perform the essential functions of the Founder's position for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or two hundred seventy (270) days in any twelve (12) month period, as determined by a qualified medical professional appointed by the Company.

4.11 Bad Leaver Defined

A "Bad Leaver" is a Founder whose Continuous Service terminates under any of the following circumstances:

(a) termination by the Company for Cause;

(b) voluntary resignation by the Founder without Good Reason; or

(c) material breach by the Founder of this Agreement, the Articles of Association, or any employment or service agreement with the Company, as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

For the avoidance of doubt, a Founder shall NOT be deemed a Bad Leaver solely by reason of the termination occurring during the Cliff Period, unless such termination is for Cause or is a voluntary resignation without Good Reason.
```

## Annotations & Explanations

### Why 4 Years with 1-Year Cliff?
- **Universal Standard**: >95% of VC-backed startups use this structure
- **Investor Expectation**: Deviating creates red flags
- **Commitment Signal**: 4 years demonstrates long-term dedication
- **Cliff Protection**: 1-year cliff protects company from early departures

### Why 25% Immediate Vesting for Emil?
- **Recognition**: Emil worked August 2024 - April 2025 (8 months) before co-founders
- **Fair Contribution**: 25% recognizes ~1 year of pre-incorporation work
- **Maintains Alignment**: Remaining 75% vests on same schedule as co-founders
- **Investor Perspective**: Reasonable recognition without undermining vesting purpose

### Why 100% Double-Trigger Acceleration?
- **Founder Protection**: Protects against post-acquisition termination without shares
- **Acquirer Acceptance**: Requires BOTH acquisition AND termination (acquirer controls whether trigger occurs)
- **Retention Incentive**: Founders incentivized to stay post-acquisition (shares only accelerate if terminated)
- **Fair Treatment**: If founders are terminated without cause after building value, they should benefit from that value

### Why 12-Month Window?
- **Standard Period**: Most acceleration provisions use 12-18 month window
- **Balances Interests**: Long enough to cover typical post-acquisition integration; short enough to limit acquirer exposure
- **Negotiable**: Can extend to 18 or 24 months if founders want more protection

---

## Alternative Language: 75% Double-Trigger Acceleration (Fallback)

If 100% acceleration meets investor resistance:

```markdown
4.2 Acceleration of Vesting (Alternative Version)

(a) Double-Trigger Acceleration. If, within twelve (12) months following a Change of Control, a Founder's Continuous Service is terminated either by the Company or successor entity without Cause or by the Founder for Good Reason, then seventy-five percent (75%) of such Founder's then-unvested Shares shall immediately vest and become non-forfeitable as of the date of such termination.
```

**Trade-Off:** Provides substantial protection (75%) while addressing investor concerns about 100% acceleration. Founders still retain significant value if terminated post-acquisition, but acquirer has reduced exposure.

---

## Customization for Regla

**Specific Adaptations:**

1. **Vesting Start Dates**: April 1, 2025 chosen as unified start date (co-founders' join date). Adjust if timing changes.

2. **Emil's Immediate Vesting**: 25% immediate vesting calculated based on ~8 months pre-work (Aug 2024 - Apr 2025). Adjust percentage if:
   - Emil worked longer before co-founders join → increase to 30-35%
   - Emil worked shorter period → decrease to 15-20%

3. **Good Reason - Location**: "50 kilometers" is appropriate for Danish context. Adjust if Regla plans international expansion requiring relocation.

4. **Cliff Period Bad Leaver Exception**: Explicitly states termination during cliff doesn't automatically trigger Bad Leaver status (lesson from Martin's draft issue).

---

## Danish Law Compliance

### Applicable Law
- Danish Company Law (Selskabsloven) governs vesting arrangements for ApS
- Vesting must be reflected in shareholder register
- Articles of Association may need to reference vesting restrictions

### Share Register
- Erhvervsstyrelsen (Danish Business Authority) requires accurate shareholder register
- Unvested shares should be noted as subject to vesting/repurchase rights
- Upon vesting events, register must be updated

### Tax Implications
- Danish tax treatment of vested vs unvested shares may differ
- Consult tax advisor (Danish accountant) on timing of taxation
- Consider whether immediate vesting for Emil triggers taxable event

# PROVISION 2: LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE

## Primary Recommended Language

```markdown
ARTICLE 5: LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE

5.1 Preference Amount

Upon any Liquidation Event (as defined in Section 5.5), the holders of Series A Preference Shares shall be entitled to receive, in preference to and priority over the holders of Ordinary Shares, an amount per Series A Preference Share equal to one times (1x) the Original Issue Price (as defined below), plus any declared but unpaid dividends on such Series A Preference Share (the "Liquidation Preference").

5.2 Non-Participating Structure

After payment in full of the Liquidation Preference to the holders of Series A Preference Shares, the remaining assets and funds of the Company legally available for distribution (the "Remaining Assets") shall be distributed to the holders of Ordinary Shares on a pro rata basis in proportion to the number of Ordinary Shares held by each such holder.

For the avoidance of doubt, holders of Series A Preference Shares shall NOT participate in the distribution of Remaining Assets after receiving their Liquidation Preference. Holders of Series A Preference Shares may elect to convert their Series A Preference Shares to Ordinary Shares pursuant to Section 5.4 in order to participate in the distribution of Remaining Assets as holders of Ordinary Shares.

5.3 Conversion Right

(a) Optional Conversion. Each holder of Series A Preference Shares shall have the right, exercisable at any time and from time to time, to convert any or all of such holder's Series A Preference Shares into Ordinary Shares at the then-applicable Conversion Rate (as defined in Article 6).

(b) Automatic Conversion. All outstanding Series A Preference Shares shall automatically convert into Ordinary Shares immediately prior to any Liquidation Event, if and only if such conversion would provide the holder with a greater economic return than receiving the Liquidation Preference.

(c) Strategic Consideration. Holders of Series A Preference Shares will evaluate whether to:
    (i) receive the Liquidation Preference (1x Original Issue Price) as preference shareholders; OR
    (ii) convert to Ordinary Shares and receive pro rata share of total proceeds.

The holder will choose whichever option provides greater economic value.

5.4 Distribution Priority

In the event of any Liquidation Event, the assets and funds of the Company available for distribution shall be distributed in the following order of priority:

    Priority 1: Payment of all debts, liabilities, and obligations of the Company in accordance with applicable law;

    Priority 2: Payment of the Liquidation Preference to holders of Series A Preference Shares;

    Priority 3: Distribution of Remaining Assets to holders of Ordinary Shares on a pro rata basis.

5.5 Liquidation Event Defined

"Liquidation Event" means:

(a) the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company;

(b) a sale, transfer, exclusive license, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company;

(c) a merger, consolidation, or similar transaction in which the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity immediately after such transaction; or

(d) a sale or transfer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Shares of the Company to a third party or group of related third parties in a single transaction or series of related transactions.

For the avoidance of doubt, a financing transaction (issuance of new shares for capital) shall not constitute a Liquidation Event.

5.6 Definitions

(a) "Original Issue Price" means, with respect to Series A Preference Shares, the price per share paid by the initial purchasers of Series A Preference Shares in the Series A financing, as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations, or similar events.

(b) "Series A Preference Shares" means the shares of the Company designated as "Series A Preference Shares" and issued in connection with the Series A financing.

(c) "Ordinary Shares" means the shares of the Company held by the Founders and designated as "Ordinary Shares" (or such other designation as may be used for common shares under Danish law).
```

## Scenario Analysis: 1x Non-Participating vs Participating

### Example Assumptions
- Series A Investment: €2,000,000 for 20% of company (post-money valuation: €10,000,000)
- Original Issue Price: €10.00 per share
- Series A Investor owns: 200,000 Series A Preference Shares
- Founders own: 800,000 Ordinary Shares

### Scenario 1: Exit at €5,000,000

**Option A: 1x Non-Participating (Recommended)**

Investor calculates two options:
- Option 1 (Take Preference): €2,000,000 (1x Original Issue Price)
- Option 2 (Convert & Take Pro Rata): €1,000,000 (20% of €5M)

**Investor chooses Option 1 (Preference):**
- Investor receives: €2,000,000 (40% of proceeds)
- Founders receive: €3,000,000 (60% of proceeds)

**Option B: 1x Participating (Unfavorable Comparison)**

Investor receives:
- Preference: €2,000,000 (gets this first)
- Pro Rata of Remaining: €600,000 (20% of remaining €3M)
- **Total: €2,600,000 (52% of proceeds)**

**Founders receive: €2,400,000 (48% of proceeds)**

**Founder Impact: -€600,000 (20% reduction) with participating structure**

---

### Scenario 2: Exit at €20,000,000

**Option A: 1x Non-Participating (Recommended)**

Investor calculates two options:
- Option 1 (Take Preference): €2,000,000 (1x)
- Option 2 (Convert & Take Pro Rata): €4,000,000 (20% of €20M)

**Investor chooses Option 2 (Convert):**
- Investor receives: €4,000,000 (20% of proceeds)
- Founders receive: €16,000,000 (80% of proceeds)

**Option B: 1x Participating (Unfavorable Comparison)**

Investor receives:
- Preference: €2,000,000
- Pro Rata of Remaining: €3,600,000 (20% of remaining €18M)
- **Total: €5,600,000 (28% of proceeds)**

**Founders receive: €14,400,000 (72% of proceeds)**

**Founder Impact: -€1,600,000 (10% reduction) with participating structure**

---

### Key Insight

**With 1x Non-Participating:**
- Small exits (< €10M): Investor takes preference, founders get remainder
- Large exits (> €10M): Investor converts, everyone shares pro rata
- Incentives aligned: Both parties benefit from higher valuations

**With Participating:**
- Investor "double dips" at all exit valuations
- Founders lose 10-20% of proceeds across all scenarios
- Misaligned incentives: Investor relatively indifferent to valuation increases

**Market Standard:** byFounders Nordic data shows 78% of Series A rounds use 1x non-participating.

---

## Annotations & Explanations

### Why 1x (Not 2x or 1.5x)?
- **Nordic Standard**: 1x is prevailing multiple in Nordic markets
- **Balanced Protection**: Investor gets capital back in modest exits, but no excessive preference in large exits
- **Founder-Friendly**: Higher multiples (2x, 3x) significantly reduce founder economics

### Why Non-Participating (Not Participating)?
- **Founder Economics**: Avoids "double dip" that reduces founder payouts by 10-20%
- **Incentive Alignment**: Both parties benefit equally from valuation increases above preference
- **Market Standard**: Nordic investors increasingly expect non-participating structure

### Why Include Conversion Right?
- **Investor Flexibility**: Investor can choose best economic outcome (preference vs conversion)
- **Automatic Mechanism**: Prevents need for separate conversion election in time-sensitive transactions

---

## Alternative Language: 1x Participating with Cap (Fallback)

If investor strongly insists on participating structure:

```markdown
5.2 Participating Structure with Cap (Alternative Version)

(a) After payment in full of the Liquidation Preference, holders of Series A Preference Shares shall participate with holders of Ordinary Shares in the distribution of Remaining Assets on an as-if-converted basis, up to a maximum total return of three times (3x) the Original Issue Price per Series A Preference Share (including the Liquidation Preference).

(b) Once holders of Series A Preference Shares have received an aggregate amount equal to three times (3x) the Original Issue Price (including the Liquidation Preference and participation), any additional Remaining Assets shall be distributed solely to holders of Ordinary Shares on a pro rata basis.
```

**Trade-Off:** Participating structure reduces founder economics, but 3x cap limits the damage. At exits >€30M (3x return for investor), founders receive all additional proceeds.

---

# PROVISION 3: DRAG-ALONG RIGHTS

## Primary Recommended Language

```markdown
ARTICLE 7: DRAG-ALONG RIGHTS

7.1 Drag-Along Right

If the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding Shares, voting together as a single class (the "Requisite Holders"), approve a Sale Transaction (as defined in Section 7.6), then all other shareholders (the "Dragged Shareholders") shall be obligated to participate in such Sale Transaction on the same terms and conditions as the Requisite Holders, subject to the provisions of this Article 7.

7.2 Obligations of Dragged Shareholders

Upon receipt of written notice from the Company that a Sale Transaction approved by the Requisite Holders is proceeding (the "Drag-Along Notice"), each Dragged Shareholder shall be obligated to:

(a) vote all of their Shares in favor of the Sale Transaction and take all other necessary or desirable actions to consummate the Sale Transaction;

(b) sell, transfer, or exchange all of their Shares to the acquirer on the same per-Share terms as the Requisite Holders (subject to Section 7.3);

(c) execute and deliver all transaction documents reasonably necessary to consummate the Sale Transaction, including but not limited to share purchase agreements, escrow agreements, indemnification agreements, and related documents;

(d) make all representations and warranties to the acquirer that are customary for transactions of such nature, provided that such representations and warranties are made by all shareholders on a pro rata basis according to shareholding percentage; and

(e) agree to any post-closing obligations (including escrows, holdbacks, or earnouts) on the same proportional basis as all other shareholders.

7.3 Same Terms Requirement

The term "same terms and conditions" as used in this Article 7 means that:

(a) All shareholders shall receive the same per-Share consideration (subject to liquidation preferences and other economic rights set forth in this Agreement);

(b) All shareholders shall be subject to the same proportional escrows, holdbacks, earnouts, or other contingent consideration arrangements;

(c) No shareholder shall receive any side payments, special consideration, or preferential treatment not offered to all shareholders on a pro rata basis; and

(d) All shareholders shall provide representations, warranties, and indemnifications on the same proportional basis (based on shareholding percentage, not dollar amount).

For the avoidance of doubt, "same terms and conditions" does not require that all shareholders receive the same dollar amount (as liquidation preferences may result in different distributions), but rather that the terms of the transaction apply equally and proportionally to all shareholders.

7.4 Founder Employment Agreements

Notwithstanding the drag-along obligations in Section 7.2, no Dragged Shareholder who is a Founder or employee shall be required to:

(a) accept employment with the acquirer on terms materially less favorable than such Founder's current employment terms; or

(b) agree to non-compete or non-solicitation restrictions (in connection with the Sale Transaction) that extend for longer than twelve (12) months or that are broader in geographic scope or subject matter than is reasonably necessary to protect the acquirer's investment.

If the acquirer requires employment agreements or non-compete provisions as a condition of the Sale Transaction, such requirements must be offered to all Founders on substantially the same terms, and any Founder may decline such employment or restrictions by forfeiting a proportional amount of the transaction consideration (as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith).

7.5 Minimum Price Protection

The drag-along right may only be exercised if the price per Share offered in the Sale Transaction results in:

(a) holders of Series A Preference Shares receiving at least one times (1x) their Original Issue Price per Share (i.e., return of invested capital); OR

(b) holders of Ordinary Shares receiving at least [€X] per Share, which shall be determined by reference to the post-money valuation at the most recent financing round; OR

(c) approval of the Sale Transaction by at least fifty percent (50%) of the holders of Ordinary Shares (i.e., Founders can approve a lower-priced transaction if they agree it is in their best interests).

The purpose of this minimum price protection is to prevent a Sale Transaction at a price that is clearly inadequate or unfair to the Dragged Shareholders.

7.6 Sale Transaction Defined

"Sale Transaction" means:

(a) a sale, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company;

(b) a merger, consolidation, or similar transaction in which the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity immediately after such transaction;

(c) a sale or transfer of more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Shares of the Company to a third party or group of related third parties in a single transaction or series of related transactions; or

(d) any other transaction that would constitute a Liquidation Event under Section 5.5.

7.7 Drag-Along Notice

The Drag-Along Notice shall include:

(a) a description of the Sale Transaction, including the identity of the acquirer, the structure of the transaction, and the proposed timing;

(b) the per-Share consideration to be received by each class of shareholders, including any escrows, holdbacks, earnouts, or contingent consideration;

(c) copies of the principal transaction documents (or drafts thereof);

(d) a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Sale Transaction, including any representations, warranties, indemnifications, or post-closing obligations;

(e) the date by which Dragged Shareholders must execute transaction documents (which shall be at least fifteen (15) Business Days from delivery of the Drag-Along Notice, or such shorter period as is reasonably necessary given transaction timing); and

(f) contact information for any questions regarding the Sale Transaction.

7.8 Liability Limitation

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the aggregate liability of any Dragged Shareholder arising from representations, warranties, or indemnifications provided in connection with a Sale Transaction shall be limited to the total consideration received by such Dragged Shareholder in the Sale Transaction (net of any escrows or holdbacks).

For the avoidance of doubt, no Dragged Shareholder shall have liability for breaches of representations or warranties made by other shareholders, except to the extent of any breaches of representations or warranties specific to such Dragged Shareholder's title to and authority to sell their Shares.
```

## Scenario Analysis: 75% vs 60% Drag-Along Threshold

### Scenario: Acquisition Offer at €8M

**Ownership Structure:**
- Founders: 70% (Emil 25%, Anton 25%, Yuri 20%)
- Series A Investor: 30%

**Investor Position:** Wants to sell at €8M offer (attractive exit for their investment)

**Founder Position:** Divided - Emil and Anton want to continue growing (believe €15M possible in 2 years); Yuri open to selling

---

**With 60% Drag-Along Threshold:**
- Investor (30%) + Yuri (20%) = 50% → **NOT sufficient to drag**
- Investor (30%) + Yuri (20%) + Anton (25%) = 75% → **CAN drag**
- **Result:** Investor can convince just one founder to approve sale, then force all others to sell
- **Founder Control:** Diminished - minority can force sale

**With 75% Drag-Along Threshold:**
- Investor (30%) + Yuri (20%) = 50% → NOT sufficient
- Investor (30%) + Yuri (20%) + Anton (25%) = 75% → **CAN drag (just meets threshold)**
- **Result:** Requires 2 of 3 founders to approve (majority of founders)
- **Founder Control:** Preserved - majority of founders must agree

**With 80% Drag-Along Threshold:**
- Investor (30%) + Yuri (20%) + Anton (25%) = 75% → **NOT sufficient**
- Investor (30%) + All 3 Founders (70%) = 100% → CAN drag
- **Result:** Requires all 3 founders to approve OR 2 founders with combined >50%
- **Founder Control:** Maximized - near-unanimous consent required

---

**Recommendation:** 75% threshold is optimal balance

**Rationale:**
- Prevents minority (investor alone or investor + 1 founder) from forcing sale
- Allows supermajority (investor + 2 founders OR all 3 founders) to proceed with beneficial transactions
- Aligns with Nordic market standard (byFounders data: 75-80% is common)

---

## Annotations & Explanations

### Why 75% Threshold (Not 60%)?
- **Founder Protection**: Prevents investor + 1 founder from forcing sale against majority founder wishes
- **Nordic Standard**: 75-80% is prevailing threshold in Nordic markets
- **Supermajority Logic**: Major transaction like sale should require broad consensus, not simple majority

### Why Include Minimum Price Protection?
- **Prevents Fire Sales**: Ensures shareholders can't be dragged into clearly inadequate transactions
- **Founder Safety Net**: Founders can approve lower-priced sale if they believe it's best option (flexibility)

### Why Limit Employment Obligations?
- **Prevents Coercion**: Dragged shareholders shouldn't be forced into unfavorable employment
- **Fairness**: If founders must work post-acquisition, terms should be reasonable

### Why Cap Liability?
- **Limited Exposure**: Shareholder liability limited to proceeds received (can't lose more than gained)
- **Individual Responsibility**: Each shareholder responsible only for their own reps/warranties

## Alternative Language: 80% Threshold (More Founder-Protective)

If founders want additional protection:

```markdown
7.1 Drag-Along Right (Alternative Version)

If the holders of at least eighty percent (80%) of the outstanding Shares, voting together as a single class, approve a Sale Transaction, then all other shareholders shall be obligated to participate in such Sale Transaction on the same terms and conditions...
```

**Trade-Off:** Higher threshold increases founder protection but makes it slightly harder to execute beneficial transactions. At Regla's 70% founder / 30% investor split post-Series A, would require 2 of 3 founders + investor OR all 3 founders.

# PROVISION 4: GOOD LEAVER / BAD LEAVER

## Primary Recommended Language

```markdown
ARTICLE 8: GOOD LEAVER PROVISIONS

8.1 Good Leaver Treatment of Unvested Shares

If a Founder's Continuous Service terminates and such Founder is classified as a Good Leaver pursuant to Section 4.10, the Company (or its designee) shall have the option (but not the obligation) to repurchase the Founder's unvested Shares at the Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 8.3), subject to the following provisions:

(a) Time-Pro-Rated Value. The purchase price for unvested Shares shall be the Fair Market Value multiplied by a time-pro-ration factor reflecting the portion of the vesting period completed.

Example Calculation:
- Founder holds 1,000,000 Shares with 4-year vesting
- Founder departs as Good Leaver after 30 months (2.5 years)
- 625,000 Shares are vested (remain with Founder - not subject to repurchase)
- 375,000 Shares are unvested
- Time-pro-ration factor: 30 months / 48 months = 62.5%
- Purchase price for unvested Shares: 375,000 × FMV × 62.5%

(b) Exercise Period. The Company must exercise its repurchase option within ninety (90) days of the termination date by providing written notice to the Founder. If the Company does not exercise the option within such period, the option shall lapse and the unvested Shares shall remain with the Founder subject to continued vesting restrictions.

(c) Payment Terms. The purchase price shall be paid within thirty (30) days of exercise of the repurchase option, either in cash or by cancellation of indebtedness owed by the Founder to the Company, at the Company's election.

(d) No Discount. The purchase price shall be the full Fair Market Value (as time-pro-rated pursuant to Section 8.1(a)), without any discount or reduction.

8.2 Good Leaver Treatment of Vested Shares

All vested Shares held by a Good Leaver shall remain the property of the Good Leaver and shall not be subject to any repurchase right by the Company, except as follows:

(a) Right of First Refusal. If the Good Leaver wishes to sell vested Shares to a third party within twelve (12) months of termination, the Company and/or the remaining shareholders shall have a right of first refusal to purchase such Shares at the price and on the terms offered by the third party, exercisable within thirty (30) days of written notice from the Good Leaver.

(b) Fair Market Value. If the Company exercises the right of first refusal, the purchase price shall be the Fair Market Value or the third party offer price, whichever is higher.

8.3 Fair Market Value Determination

"Fair Market Value" of the Shares shall be determined as follows:

(a) Recent Financing. If the Company has completed an arms-length equity financing within the immediately preceding six (6) months, Fair Market Value shall be the price per Share paid in such financing (adjusted appropriately for different share classes).

(b) Pending Financing or Exit. If the Company is in active negotiations for an equity financing or Sale Transaction and has received a binding term sheet or letter of intent, Fair Market Value shall be the price per Share implied by such term sheet or letter of intent.

(c) Independent Valuation. If neither Section 8.3(a) nor Section 8.3(b) applies, Fair Market Value shall be determined by an independent business appraiser selected by mutual agreement of the Company and the Founder (or, if unable to agree within fifteen (15) days, by an independent appraiser appointed by the Danish Business Authority or equivalent professional body). The cost of the independent valuation shall be borne equally by the Company and the Founder.

(d) Valuation Methodology. The independent appraiser shall use generally accepted valuation methodologies appropriate for early-stage companies, including but not limited to discounted cash flow analysis, comparable company analysis, and/or comparable transaction analysis.

8.4 Rationale for Good Leaver Provisions

The Good Leaver provisions recognize that a Founder who departs under positive circumstances (e.g., without cause termination, mutual agreement) has contributed value to the Company during their tenure. While unvested Shares are not fully earned, the time-pro-rated Fair Market Value payment provides fair compensation for the portion of the vesting period completed.

---

ARTICLE 9: BAD LEAVER PROVISIONS

9.1 Bad Leaver Treatment of Unvested Shares

If a Founder's Continuous Service terminates and such Founder is classified as a Bad Leaver pursuant to Section 4.11, the Company shall have the option (but not the obligation) to repurchase the Founder's unvested Shares at the Lower of Fair Market Value or Par Value (as defined in Section 9.3), subject to the following provisions:

(a) Reduced Value. The purchase price for unvested Shares shall be the lower of:
    (i) Fair Market Value (as defined in Section 8.3); OR
    (ii) Par Value (nominal value per Share under Danish law, currently DKK [insert amount per Share]).

(b) Rationale. The reduced purchase price reflects the fact that the Founder's departure as a Bad Leaver (for Cause, voluntary resignation without Good Reason, or material breach) has potentially harmed the Company and the Founder has not fulfilled their vesting obligations.

(c) Exercise Period. The Company must exercise its repurchase option within ninety (90) days of the termination date by providing written notice to the Founder. If the Company does not exercise the option within such period, the option shall lapse and the unvested Shares shall remain with the Founder subject to continued vesting restrictions.

(d) Payment Terms. The purchase price shall be paid within thirty (30) days of exercise of the repurchase option, either in cash or by cancellation of indebtedness owed by the Founder to the Company, at the Company's election.

9.2 Bad Leaver Treatment of Vested Shares

All vested Shares held by a Bad Leaver shall remain the property of the Bad Leaver and shall NOT be subject to repurchase by the Company at a reduced price, EXCEPT in the following circumstance:

(a) Material Breach Causing Harm. If the Founder's termination as a Bad Leaver was due to a material breach that caused direct, quantifiable financial harm to the Company (e.g., fraud, embezzlement, theft of trade secrets resulting in lost revenue), the Company may have a repurchase option for vested Shares at Fair Market Value minus documented damages, up to a maximum discount of fifty percent (50%).

(b) Limitation. In no event shall the Company have the right to repurchase vested Shares from a Bad Leaver at Par Value. Vested Shares have been fully earned and should be treated as the Founder's property, except in cases of serious misconduct causing demonstrable harm.

(c) Right of First Refusal. If the Bad Leaver wishes to sell vested Shares to a third party within twenty-four (24) months of termination, the Company and/or the remaining shareholders shall have a right of first refusal to purchase such Shares at the price and on the terms offered by the third party, exercisable within thirty (30) days of written notice from the Bad Leaver.

9.3 Par Value Defined

"Par Value" means the nominal value per Share as set forth in the Articles of Association of the Company. As of the Effective Date, the Par Value is DKK [insert amount] per Share (approximately €[convert to EUR] per Share).

9.4 Rationale for Bad Leaver Provisions

The Bad Leaver provisions recognize that a Founder who departs under negative circumstances (for Cause, voluntary resignation without Good Reason, or material breach) has not fulfilled their commitment to the Company. The reduced purchase price for unvested Shares reflects the Company's interest in recapturing equity that was conditioned on continued service.

However, vested Shares have been fully earned and should not be subject to punitive buyback except in cases of serious misconduct causing demonstrable financial harm.

9.5 Important Protection: Vested Shares Are VESTED

**CRITICAL PROVISION:** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, vested Shares shall be treated as the Founder's property and shall NOT be subject to repurchase by the Company at Par Value solely due to Bad Leaver status.

This provision directly addresses the critical issue identified in Martin's draft SA, where Bad Leaver status could result in repurchase of ALL shares (including vested) at Par Value (DKK 6,668 / ~€895), creating extreme and unconscionable downside risk.

**Lesson Applied:** A Founder who has vested 75% of their shares over 3 years (building significant company value) and is then terminated for Cause should not lose €3.3M of value by having vested shares repurchased for €895. Vested means EARNED.
```

## Scenario Analysis: Good vs Bad Leaver Treatment

### Setup
- Founder: 1,000,000 Shares allocated
- Vesting: 4 years with 1-year cliff
- Fair Market Value: €10 per Share
- Par Value: €0.001 per Share (DKK 0.00667)
- Departure: Month 30 (2.5 years into 4-year vesting)

### Vesting Status at Departure
- **Vested:** 625,000 Shares (25% cliff at month 12 + 25 months × 1/48 monthly = 250K + 375K)
- **Unvested:** 375,000 Shares

---

### Scenario A: Good Leaver (Terminated Without Cause)

**Vested Shares (625,000):**
- Remain with Founder
- Fair Market Value: 625,000 × €10 = **€6,250,000**
- Company has ROFR if Founder sells within 12 months, but at FMV

**Unvested Shares (375,000):**
- Company option to repurchase at time-pro-rated FMV
- Time-pro-ration: 30 months / 48 months = 62.5%
- Purchase price: 375,000 × €10 × 62.5% = **€2,343,750**

**Founder Total Recovery:**
- Vested: €6,250,000 (keeps)
- Unvested: €2,343,750 (if Company exercises repurchase)
- **Total: €8,593,750**

**Rationale:** Founder earned vested shares through 2.5 years of service. Unvested shares partially earned (62.5%), so Founder receives fair value for time contributed.

---

### Scenario B: Bad Leaver (Terminated for Cause)

**Vested Shares (625,000):**
- Remain with Founder (PROTECTED by our provision)
- Fair Market Value: 625,000 × €10 = **€6,250,000**
- **CRITICAL:** Under our language, vested shares NOT subject to Par Value repurchase

**Unvested Shares (375,000):**
- Company option to repurchase at lower of FMV or Par Value
- FMV: 375,000 × €10 = €3,750,000
- Par Value: 375,000 × €0.001 = €375
- Company chooses Par Value: **€375**

**Founder Total Recovery:**
- Vested: €6,250,000 (keeps)
- Unvested: €375 (loses unvested shares for nominal amount)
- **Total: €6,250,375**

**Difference vs Good Leaver:** -€2,343,375 (loses the time-pro-rated value of unvested shares)

---

### Scenario C: Martin's Draft (EXTREME BAD LEAVER RISK)

**What Martin's draft allowed:**

**Vested Shares (625,000):**
- Company could repurchase at Par Value
- 625,000 × €0.001 = **€625**

**Unvested Shares (375,000):**
- Company could repurchase at Par Value
- 375,000 × €0.001 = **€375**

**Founder Total Recovery: €1,000** (loses €9.999M of value)

**This is unconscionable and our provision PREVENTS this outcome.**

---

## Annotations & Explanations

### Why Good Leaver Gets Time-Pro-Rated FMV?
- **Fairness**: Founder contributed value during 2.5 years of service
- **Incentive**: Departing founders know they'll receive fair treatment
- **Market Standard**: Time-pro-rated FMV is common in European markets

### Why Bad Leaver Loses Unvested at Par Value?
- **Commitment Penalty**: Founder breached commitment (Cause, voluntary departure)
- **Company Recapture**: Company needs to recapture equity for replacement hire
- **Deterrent**: Discourages bad behavior and uncommitted departures

### Why Vested Shares Protected Even for Bad Leaver?
- **Earned Equity**: Vested shares were earned through service performed
- **Unconscionable Otherwise**: Losing years of built value for nominal amount (€895) is unfair
- **Lesson from Martin's Draft**: We explicitly reject the Par Value buyback of vested shares

### Why Cap Discount at 50% for Material Breach of Vested Shares?
- **Serious Misconduct Only**: Only applies when breach caused quantifiable financial harm
- **Documented Damages**: Company must prove harm (not speculative)
- **Limited Reduction**: Even in worst case, Founder retains 50% of value

## Customization for Regla

**Specific Adaptations:**

1. **Par Value**: Insert actual Par Value from Regla's Articles of Association (likely DKK 1-10 per share, convert to EUR)

2. **Time-Pro-Ration Percentage**: Recommended 62.5% (actual time served / total vesting period). Could adjust to:
   - 50% (less generous)
   - 75% (more generous)
   - 100% minus unvested portion (effectively FMV for pro-rated vested portion)

3. **ROFR Period**: 12 months for Good Leaver, 24 months for Bad Leaver. Adjust based on preference for liquidity restrictions.

4. **Independent Valuation**: Specify "Danish Business Authority or equivalent professional body" as appointing authority if parties can't agree on appraiser.

---

## Danish Law Compliance

### Share Repurchase Rules
- Danish Company Law (Selskabsloven) permits repurchase of shares subject to:
  - Board authorization in Articles of Association
  - Solvency requirements (company must remain solvent after repurchase)
  - Par Value payment minimum (can't buy below Par Value)

### Tax Implications
- Repurchase of shares at FMV may trigger capital gains tax for selling Founder
- Time-pro-rated value payment may be characterized differently than full FMV sale
- Consult Danish tax advisor on treatment of Good Leaver / Bad Leaver payments

### Articles of Association
- Repurchase provisions must be authorized in Articles
- May require amendment to Articles to implement Good/Bad Leaver provisions
- Shareholder register must reflect repurchased shares (canceled or held as treasury)
