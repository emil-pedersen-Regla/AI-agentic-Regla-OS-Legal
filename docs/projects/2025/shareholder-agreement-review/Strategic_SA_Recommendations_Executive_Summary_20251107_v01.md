# Strategic Shareholder Agreement Recommendations: Executive Summary
**Prepared For:** Emil Timmreck Pedersen, CEO - Regla ApS
**Prepared By:** Regla Legal Module - Superior AI Legal Expert System
**Date:** November 7, 2025
**Purpose:** Strategic guidance for optimal SA structure

---

## Mission

Provide Emil with comprehensive strategic recommendations for structuring Regla ApS's Shareholder Agreement to protect founder interests, attract investors, enable operational flexibility, and scale through multiple funding rounds.

---

## Top 10 Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Standard 4-Year Vesting with Double-Trigger Acceleration** (CRITICAL)
Adopt market-standard 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff for all founders, but include 75-100% double-trigger acceleration (acquisition + termination) to protect founders post-exit. Recognize Emil's early start by vesting 25% of his allocation immediately.

**Why:** Signals commitment to investors while protecting founders from post-acquisition termination without shares.

---

### 2. **1x Non-Participating Liquidation Preference** (CRITICAL)
Establish 1x non-participating liquidation preference as the Nordic standard. Investors choose EITHER their investment back OR pro-rata share (not both).

**Why:** Founder-friendly structure that is Nordic market standard. At €10M exit, founders receive €8M vs €6.4M with participating preference (20% difference).

---

###3. **Bad Leaver Applies to Unvested Shares Only** (CRITICAL)
Bad leaver provisions should apply ONLY to unvested shares, with vested shares purchased at fair market value. Never allow par value buyback of vested shares.

**Why:** Martin's draft allowed €3.3M in vested shares to be bought for €895 (99.97% loss). This is unconscionable.

---

### 4. **75-80% Drag-Along Threshold** (HIGH PRIORITY)
Set drag-along rights threshold at 75-80% of outstanding shares (Nordic standard), not 60%.

**Why:** At 60%, investors with majority stake can force sale against founders' will. At 75%, founders retain meaningful veto on bad deals.

---

### 5. **Operational Authority Thresholds** (HIGH PRIORITY)
CEO has autonomous authority for contracts <€50K, expenses <€25K, hiring <€100K salary. Board approval required above these thresholds.

**Why:** Prevents operational paralysis from unanimous consent requirements. Emil needs ability to run company day-to-day.

---

### 6. **CEO Tiebreaker with Override** (HIGH PRIORITY)
Include CEO tiebreaker mechanism for deadlocks, overridable by 2/3 shareholder vote.

**Why:** Prevents company paralysis. CEO can break ties for operational decisions, but founders can override if CEO abuses authority.

---

### 7. **Dual-Class Shares Post-Series A** (STRATEGIC)
Include provision for dual-class shares (10:1 voting) to be implemented at Series A to preserve founder control through later rounds.

**Why:** Standard in tech companies. Allows founders to maintain control while raising capital. Must be implemented early—difficult to add later.

---

### 8. **10% ESOP Reserved** (INVESTMENT READINESS)
Reserve 10% of fully-diluted shares for Employee Stock Option Pool, established pre-Series A.

**Why:** Investors expect ESOP. Pre-funding establishment means founders dilute to create pool, not just investors. Signals planning sophistication.

---

### 9. **Founder-Controlled Board Pre-Series A** (CONTROL)
3-person board pre-Series A: 2 founder seats + 1 independent. Expands to 5 at Series A: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent.

**Why:** Founders maintain control through first institutional round. Independent director adds outside perspective without investor bias.

---

### 10. **Broad-Based Weighted Average Anti-Dilution** (INVESTOR PROTECTION)
Include broad-based weighted average anti-dilution protection for investors (NOT full ratchet).

**Why:** Market standard investor protection that's not overly punitive to founders. Full ratchet would massively dilute founders in down rounds.

---

## Guiding Principles for Regla's SA

These 7 principles guide all recommendations:

1. **Founder Alignment** → All founders' incentives align for long-term value creation
2. **Investor Readiness** → SA doesn't require renegotiation in Series A
3. **Operational Autonomy** → CEO controls day-to-day decisions without approval
4. **Control Preservation** → Founders maintain >50% voting through Series A
5. **Fair Exit** → Pro-rata treatment with reasonable investor preference
6. **Dispute Efficiency** → Deadlocks resolve through clear mechanisms within 90 days
7. **Evolution Design** → SA specifies how it adapts through funding rounds

---

## Critical Decisions Requiring Input

### Decision 1: Founder Vesting Structure
**Question:** How much of Emil's allocation should vest immediately to recognize pre-incorporation work?

**Options:**
- A) 0% (all subject to 4-year vesting) → Most investor-friendly
- B) 25% immediate, 75% vesting → Balanced (RECOMMENDED)
- C) 50% immediate, 50% vesting → Founder-favorable

**Trade-off:** Higher immediate vesting = more founder protection, but may concern investors about commitment.

**Recommendation:** Option B (25% immediate) balances recognition of Emil's early work with signaling long-term commitment.

---

### Decision 2: Dual-Class Shares Timing
**Question:** When should dual-class shares (10:1 voting) be implemented?

**Options:**
- A) Now (pre-investment) → Challenging for first investors
- B) At Series A → Standard timing (RECOMMENDED)
- C) Later (Series B+) → May be too late

**Trade-off:** Earlier = more founder control, but harder to raise first round. Later = easier initial fundraising, but may be impossible to implement after multiple investors.

**Recommendation:** Option B—include provision in current SA, implement at Series A.

---

### Decision 3: Board Composition Evolution
**Question:** How should board scale through funding rounds?

**Options:**
- A) Founders maintain majority forever → Unrealistic
- B) Balanced board (equal founders/investors) at Series A → Standard (RECOMMENDED)
- C) Investor majority at Series A → Unfavorable

**Trade-off:** Founder control vs investor expectations.

**Recommendation:** Option B—Founders control through Series A, balanced thereafter.

---

### Decision 4: Reserved Matters List
**Question:** What decisions require investor consent?

**Options:**
- A) Minimal list (sale of company, capital changes only) → Founder-favorable
- B) Standard list (+ material contracts, senior hires, IP licensing) → Balanced (RECOMMENDED)
- C) Extensive list (+ routine operations) → Investor-favorable, operational burden

**Trade-off:** Fewer reserved matters = more autonomy but less investor protection. More = greater oversight but slower decisions.

**Recommendation:** Option B—protect investors on major decisions without micromanagement.

---

### Decision 5: Good Leaver Treatment
**Question:** What happens to unvested shares if founder leaves voluntarily (good leaver)?

**Options:**
- A) Company buys at par value → Unfair to departing founder
- B) Company buys at fair market value, time-pro-rated → Balanced (RECOMMENDED)
- C) Founder keeps all unvested shares → Unfair to remaining

**Trade-off:** Fairness to departing founder vs protection of remaining team.

**Recommendation:** Option B—departing founder receives value for time contributed, remaining unvested stays with company.

---

## Negotiation Priorities

### MUST-HAVE (Non-Negotiable - Will Not Sign Without)
1. Vesting applies to unvested shares only (not vested)
2. Fair market value for vested shares in all exit scenarios
3. 1x non-participating liquidation preference (not participating)
4. CEO operational authority (not unanimous consent for routine decisions)
5. Drag-along threshold ≥75% (not 60%)

### IMPORTANT (Strong Push - Will Negotiate Hard)
6. 75-100% double-trigger acceleration on acquisition
7. Dual-class share provision for future implementation
8. CEO tiebreaker mechanism for deadlocks
9. Good leaver receives FMV for time-vested portion
10. Reserved matters limited to truly material decisions

### NEGOTIABLE (Nice to Have - Will Accept Compromise)
11. Specific threshold amounts (€50K vs €75K for contracts)
12. Board composition timing (3→5 at Series A vs later)
13. Information rights frequency (monthly vs quarterly)
14. ESOP percentage (10% vs 12% vs 15%)

### ACCEPT (Market Standard - No Negotiation Needed)
15. 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff structure
16. Broad-based weighted average anti-dilution
17. Standard ROFR (right of first refusal) on share transfers
18. Reasonable representations and warranties
19. Danish law and jurisdiction

## Key Insights from Martin's Draft Review

**What We Learned:** The systematic review of Martin's draft SA identified 18 material issues, including:
- Vesting period extended from 2→4 years without defining start dates
- Bad leaver provision allowed par value buyback of ALL shares (even vested)
- Unanimous consent required for hiring, creating operational paralysis
- Copy-paste errors (wrong industry in non-compete clause)

**Strategic Implication:** These issues demonstrate the importance of:
1. **Explicit definitions** (no blank fields or undefined terms)
2. **Founder protection** (bad leaver applies to unvested only)
3. **Operational feasibility** (appropriate thresholds, not unanimous consent)
4. **Quality control** (verify all provisions are customized for Regla)

**Action:** Use these learnings to proactively design optimal SA structure.

## Regla-Specific Considerations

### Three Founders with Staggered Starts
- **Challenge:** Emil started Aug 15, 2024; Anton/Yuri expected Apr 1, 2025 (8-month gap)
- **Solution:** Recognize Emil's early work with 25% immediate vesting; apply same 4-year vesting to all from their respective start dates
- **Benefit:** Fair treatment of differential contributions while maintaining equal forward incentives

### Medical Device Compliance Industry
- **Challenge:** Regulatory environment requires stable, long-term commitment
- **Solution:** Strong IP assignment and confidentiality provisions; non-compete limited to medical device compliance (not "alcohol free wine")
- **Benefit:** Protects sensitive regulatory knowledge and customer relationships

### Danish ApS Structure
- **Challenge:** Danish corporate law requirements and Nordic market standards
- **Solution:** Use Nordic-standard terms (1x non-part, 75% drag-along, broad-based WAA)
- **Benefit:** Investor recognition of market standards, easier Series A fundraising

### Pre-Investment Stage
- **Challenge:** Limited negotiation leverage with first investor
- **Solution:** Establish optimal founder-founder SA now; negotiate investor terms later
- **Benefit:** Founders aligned before external parties involved
