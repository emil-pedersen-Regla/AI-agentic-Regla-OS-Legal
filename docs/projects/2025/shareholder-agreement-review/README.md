## Analysis Framework

Use this framework to structure the analysis:

### 1. Investment Terms
- Investment amount and valuation (pre-money, post-money)
- Share class (ordinary vs preference shares)
- Vesting schedules (founder vesting - 4-year/1-year cliff is standard)
- Anti-dilution provisions (full ratchet vs weighted average)
- Liquidation preferences (1x non-participating is standard)

### 2. Governance
- Board composition (founder seats, investor seats, independent seats)
- Voting rights (per-share vs class-based)
- Reserved matters (what requires supermajority or investor consent)
- Information rights (financial statements, metrics, board observers)
- Protective provisions (investor veto rights)

### 3. Exit Provisions
- Drag-along rights (can investors force sale?)
- Tag-along rights (can founders join investor sale?)
- Right of First Refusal (ROFR) on share transfers
- Co-sale rights (investor can sell alongside founders)
- Lock-up periods (restrictions on selling after exit)

### 4. Protective Provisions for Founders
- Founder vesting (are founders subject to vesting? Acceleration terms?)
- Non-compete and non-solicitation (how restrictive? Duration? Geography?)
- IP assignment (confirm Regla owns all IP)
- Confidentiality obligations
- Founder termination scenarios (what happens to unvested shares?)

### 5. Economic Terms
- Dividend rights (preference vs ordinary)
- Distribution priorities (who gets paid first in exit)
- Conversion rights (can preference convert to ordinary?)
- Redemption rights (can investor demand buyback?)
- Participating preference (gets preference + pro-rata share - less favorable for founders)

### 6. Operational Clauses
- Representations and warranties (what is Regla representing as true?)
- Conditions precedent (what must happen before closing?)
- Covenants (ongoing obligations - e.g., provide financial statements)
- Indemnification (who indemnifies whom for what breaches?)
- Dispute resolution (Danish courts? Arbitration? Jurisdiction?)

## Risk Assessment Categories

Use four-tier categorization:

### 🔴 Critical (Deal-Breakers)
- Could result in loss of company control
- Catastrophic financial liability
- Threatens business viability
- **Action**: Immediate escalation, must resolve before execution

### 🟠 High Priority
- Significant financial exposure
- Operational restrictions limiting growth
- Unusual terms not standard for market
- IP risks affecting core assets
- **Action**: Must address before execution, negotiate strongly

### 🟡 Medium Priority
- Moderate impact
- Standard but unfavorable terms
- Areas where negotiation may improve terms
- Administrative burdens
- **Action**: Recommend negotiation, not deal-breakers

### 🟢 Low Priority
- Minor impact
- Standard market terms
- Clarifications improving understanding
- Administrative improvements
- **Action**: Note for completeness, low priority in negotiation

## Market Standards Reference

### Standard Terms (Generally Acceptable)
- **Vesting**: 4 years with 1-year cliff
- **Liquidation Preference**: 1x non-participating
- **Anti-Dilution**: Weighted average (broad-based)
- **Board**: Founder-controlled until Series A, then balanced
- **ROFR/Co-Sale**: Standard for all shareholders
- **Drag-Along**: Threshold of 75%+ shareholders

### Founder-Friendly Terms (Ideal)
- Single-trigger vesting acceleration on sale
- No participating liquidation preference
- Founder board control maintained
- No founder non-compete (or limited scope/duration)
- Minimal reserved matters (investor veto rights)

### Investor-Friendly Terms (Less Favorable)
- Participating liquidation preference
- Full ratchet anti-dilution
- Founder subject to vesting with no acceleration
- Broad founder non-compete
- Extensive reserved matters (investor veto on many decisions)
- Redemption rights (investor can force buyback)

- **Prioritization**: Critical issues must be flagged clearly
