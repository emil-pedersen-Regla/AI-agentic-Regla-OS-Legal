## APPENDIX A: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Q1: Why is the purchase price DKK 6,668?

**A**: This is the original incorporation price that Anton paid when Regla was founded on March 6, 2025. The incorporation document shows shares were subscribed at "kurs 100" (par value), meaning no premium or discount. Anton paid DKK 6,668 for nominal capital of DKK 6,668. This is a fair, at-par buyback.

### Q2: Is there a shareholders' agreement we need to comply with?

**A**: NO. There is only a DRAFT shareholders' agreement from Moalem Weitemeyer law firm dated August 5, 2025, which was never signed or executed. Since it's only a draft, it has no legal effect, and no shareholders' agreement restrictions apply to this transaction.

### Q3: Do we need board approval for this share transfer?

**A**: Possibly, depending on what the articles of association (vedtægter) say. Emil should review the Regla ApS vedtægter dated April 25, 2025 to confirm. If board approval is required, we can easily obtain it - all three current directors (Emil, Yuri, Anton) can vote to approve at a board meeting.

### Q4: Can Anton remain as a director after selling his shares?

**A**: Legally yes, but practically no. The Share Transfer Agreement requires Anton to resign as director as part of the clean exit. This is standard and appropriate.

### Q5: What if we can't complete the transaction by the Closing Date?

**A**: The Share Transfer Agreement can be amended by written agreement of all parties. If you need more time, simply agree on a new Closing Date in writing (email is fine) before the original date.

### Q6: Are there any tax implications?

**A**: Anton's holding company (Tonne Holding ApS) is selling shares at the same price it paid (DKK 6,668 cost basis, DKK 6,668 sale price). This is a zero-gain transaction, so no capital gains tax should apply. However, consult with Regla's accountant to confirm.

### Q7: What if Anton has unpaid expenses?

**A**: The Share Transfer Agreement includes an exception in the release clause (Section 7.1) that preserves Anton's right to claim any unpaid salary or expenses owed by Regla. Emil should verify with Anton BEFORE signing that all expenses have been reimbursed and all compensation is paid, to avoid post-closing disputes.

### Q8: How long does Erhvervsstyrelsen filing take?

**A**: Typically 3-5 business days for each filing. Sometimes faster, rarely longer. You can check status on Virk.dk after filing.

### Q9: What if one of us changes our mind?

**A**: Before signing, any party can withdraw. After signing, the agreement is binding and enforceable. This is why it's important that everyone is comfortable with the terms before signing.

### Q10: Do we need a lawyer to review this?

**A**: The Share Transfer Agreement is comprehensive and based on legal best practices. However, if you want additional peace of mind, you can have Martin (external counsel) review it. Given the transaction's simplicity and low risk, this may not be necessary, but it's Emil's choice.
