### 3. Financial Terms Analysis

#### 3.1 Purchase Price Calculation

**Original Incorporation Price (Per CVR)**:
- The CVR registration shows: "Indbetalt kontant kr. 20,004,00 til kurs 100,00, fuldt indbetalt"
- Translation: Paid in cash DKK 20,004 at par value (100%), fully paid
- **Kurs 100 = Par value** (no premium or discount)

**Anton's Original Investment**:
- Shares with nominal value: DKK 6,668
- Paid at par (kurs 100): DKK 6,668
- **Original incorporation price = DKK 6,668**

**Purchase Price for Buyback**:
- **Total**: DKK 6,668 (original incorporation price)
- **Emil's portion (50%)**: DKK 3,334
- **Yuri's portion (50%)**: DKK 3,334

#### 3.2 Financial Fairness Assessment

**✅ FAIR TRANSACTION**

**Rationale**:
1. **At-Par Buyback**: Anton receives exactly what he paid (no loss)
2. **Early-Stage Exit**: Company incorporated March 2025, only ~8 months old
3. **Pre-Revenue**: Regla appears to be pre-revenue or early revenue (2 employees as of Aug 2025)
4. **Amicable Exit**: Buyback at par is reasonable for early founder departure
5. **No Value Creation**: Insufficient time for significant value creation to justify premium

**Market Standard**: Par-value buyouts are standard for early-stage founder exits, especially within first year.

#### 3.3 Tax Considerations

**⚠️ IMPORTANT - Verify with Accountant/Tax Advisor**:

1. **Danish Capital Gains Tax**:
   - Sale of shares by holding company (Tonne Holding ApS) may be subject to Danish corporate taxation
   - No capital gain here (selling at cost basis = DKK 6,668, purchased at DKK 6,668)
   - **No tax liability expected** (zero gain)

2. **Stamp Duty / Transfer Tax**:
   - Denmark generally does **not** impose stamp duty on share transfers
   - **No transfer tax expected**

3. **VAT**:
   - Share transfers are generally **exempt** from VAT
   - **No VAT liability**

4. **Registration Fees**:
   - Erhvervsstyrelsen filing fee: Typically DKK 670-900 (minor administrative cost)
   - **Nominal cost only**

**Recommendation**: Confirm with Regla's accountant or tax advisor that zero-gain transaction has no unexpected tax consequences.

### 4. Legal Requirements & Compliance

#### 4.1 Danish Companies Act (Selskabsloven) Requirements

**✅ Share Transfer Requirements**:

1. **Written Agreement Required**: ✅ Share Transfer Agreement prepared
2. **Board Approval**: Check if articles of association require board approval
   - **Action**: Review Regla ApS vedtægter (articles of association) dated April 25, 2025
   - **Typical**: Board approval often required for share transfers in ApS
3. **Shareholder Consent**: Check for pre-emption rights or transfer restrictions
   - **Status**: CVR shows no indication of restrictions (no shareholder agreement filed)
   - **Action**: Confirm with Emil and Yuri that no shareholders' agreement exists with transfer restrictions
4. **Registration**: Must file change in ownership with Erhvervsstyrelsen
   - **Deadline**: No statutory deadline, but 5 business days is best practice
   - **Form**: "Anmeldelse om ændring af ejerforhold" (notification of ownership change)

#### 4.2 Required Corporate Actions

| Action | Responsibility | Timing | Status |
|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Execute Share Transfer Agreement | All parties | Before/at Closing | ⏳ Pending |
| Anton resigns as director | Anton | At/before Closing | ⏳ Pending |
| Board meeting to approve transfer | Emil (as managing director) | At/before Closing | ⏳ Pending |

#### 4.3 Articles of Association Review

**⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED**: Review Regla ApS articles of association (vedtægter dated April 25, 2025) to verify:

1. **Transfer Restrictions**: Are there any restrictions on share transfers?
   - Typical provisions: Board approval required, other shareholders have right of first refusal
2. **Pre-emption Rights**: Do existing shareholders have right of first refusal?
3. **Drag-Along / Tag-Along**: Any drag-along or tag-along rights?
4. **Share Classes**: Confirm all shares are same class (CVR shows "Kapitalklasser: Nej" = no share classes)
5. **Director Appointment/Removal**: How are directors appointed/removed?

**Expected Finding**: Small ApS companies often have minimal transfer restrictions, especially among founders.

**If Articles Require Board Approval**:
- Convene board meeting (Emil, Yuri, Anton)
- Adopt resolution approving share transfer
- Anton can vote as director to approve (no conflict as transaction is at fair value)
